And that is the \"purchase\" of Season 1.  Some have expressed concern that they have purchased Season 1 and yet the second half of it will not come on air until later this year.  This has led some to believe that they will be charged again for a Season they have already purchased.. . In fact, this may be the case.  It all depends on the studio and how they market the product.  If this so called \"second half\" comes on air and is still referred to as Season 1, then no further charges should follow.  However, if the studio (for what ever reason) decides to list the following episodes as Season 2, then they can charge another fee for the new season.. Take for example the show, \"The Black List\".  A favorite of mine and I watched all of Season 1 (some 20 episodes) and when Season 2 came available on Amazon, I had no hesitation in purchasing it.  Well about half way through (in November last year) it was suddenly announced that the \"finale\" would air and The Black List would not return until February this year.  Ok, so along came February and The Black List started up again. I was pleased to find that the episodes beginning in February were still referred to as Season 2 and I have been receiving each episode in my library at no additional charge.. So I guess it all comes down to how the program producers market their product.  If a person purchases a Season of a program, then they should. rightfully expect to receive all episodes of that season for the price paid.  Any additional seasons would attract additional costs.. . OK, so now the program itself.  And let me be honest.  I have not read any books related to this program and if I had I would NOT try to compare this program to something I had read in a book.  Book reviews are book reviews.  Movie and TV show reviews are just that and the two have no place together in the one review.. . I have watched every current episode of this season and while it, at first, piqued my interest, as it progressed, my interest began to wane, slowly at first and in the end very rapidly.  While I enjoy (as much as the next person) tales of \"wee things that go bump in the night\",  The settings were very good, the scenery great and most of the acting plausible.  I did not enjoy the on-going narrative by Claire.  It gave the program almost a \"documentary\" feel.  While the use of the common language (Gaelic) added some realism, the \"whispered\" explanations to Claire may have given her some understanding of what was going on, but to us viewers it left a lot to be desired as most of the \"whispers\" were just that and very difficult to make sense of.  While sub-titles have their own set of problems, if they add to the viewers understanding of the flow of the conversation, then they are much better than \"whispered explanations\".. SEX.  Yes, what would any \"love story\" be without a bit of sex tossed in?  But sometimes it can become a long drawn out boring addition to a tale and that is what happened with \"Outlander\".. As for our heroine Claire, she seemed to have a great deal of difficulty keeping her mind on her ultimate goal, i.e. getting back to her own time and her husband.  In the end, she came so close, but if that had happened, their would have been little value in continuing the tale.  All of which leads me to believe that it was the old producers trick to try and encourage viewers to come back to a \"New Season\", to find out what happens.. As for me, I won't be back.  As I said I began to lose interest early on and by the end all I could foresee was more of the same being served up over and over again.  Will Claire ever make it back to her husband (in 1945) or will she end up staying with her husband of earlier times.  I don't really much care and as for Claire, she seemed to enjoy both equally well so I guess it shouldn't matter.. To be sure, if this program attracts enough of an audience for advertisers to want to support it, it will continue on in it's endless and senseless repetition of sex and violence but ultimately the ratings will begin to fall and when that happens, it will not matter at what stage of development the story has reached, it will simply be dropped like a hot coal.", "timestamp": 1423872000, "rating": 2, "sentiment": 0.1347745840760546, "overall": 4.836936460190136, "wordCount": 329, "customer": {"customerId": "A17AIGFMPB611N", "name": "Mumbojumbo", "cluster": 0}, "product": {"asin": "B00M0GMC26", "title": "Outlander - Season 1", "brand": "Caitriona Balfe", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ELF83pqjL.jpg", "price": 16.71, "categories": ["Studio Specials", "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "All Sony Pictures Titles"], "avgRating": 4.733264355923435, "avgSentiment": 0.4529220593668184, "avgOverall": 8.365569504340481, "reviewCount": 9665}}, {"summary": "Not recommended", "review": "We really liked the movie, well done.

Bad lighting, ridiculous costumes, unfortunate makeup, masks galore, and awkward close-ups don't help either.  It's not just the indistinct dreamy quality of the cinematography that's at fault; the story is also vague and repetitive.  It follows the adventures of a youth named Ilius who has a magic bow.  He isn't exactly given a quest he just wanders around saving people and needing saving himself; enter Mace a loner with an affinity for animals.  They wander around fighting and evading the sinister wolfmen led by the EVIL Ohkren.  (She can afford a golden mask but has little else to wear.)  Worried for her life, Ohkren summons Zora who vows to kill the wanderer Ilius.  Can anyone stop her reign of terror before boredom sets in?. . It's bad enough that most of the daylight shots are overexposed and lost in a haze of smoke, even worse, the pivotal fight sequence is done entirely in the dark, the results displayed after the fact.  Nudity and some gore (not enough as far as I'm concerned) are peppered here and there, lost in the vast stretches between these scenes.  I expected more from Fulci.

The Waffen SS is sent to The Keep to find the killer and punish the villagers. I waited a long time to get a new copy and when I finaly did get one I was really let down, I did not know about the book that the film ws based on so I thought this was going to be a WW2 shoot-em-up, it's not. Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot) plays the Wehrmacht officer in charge, Gabriel Byrne (Stigmata) plays the Waffen SS commander and Scott Glen (Urban Cowboy) plays some sort of angel who's destiny it is to fight the demon that is trying to escape from The Keep. Prochnow should have played the angel, his talent is wasted in the role he has in this film. Byrne and Glen offer solid if not wooden performances. Glen has one hot sex scene with the daughter of a Nazi prisoner, it's one of the few highlights of this film. The background music was done by the band Tangerine Dream and it is the very best thing this film has to offer, it is the only reason I gave this movie any stars. There is very little scenery for a movie set in the Rumanian mountains, you also never really get to see The Keep itself, only fleeting glimpses here and there which is disapointing. When two soldiers plundering release the Demon the stage is set and the killing starts. The Demon's appearance is really cheesy, the glowing red eyes look like something out of Superman or KISS Meets The Demon. Think of the scene in Raiders Of The Lost Ark when the Nazi archaeologist opens the Ark and releases the angels of vengence that kill all the Nazi's who gaze upon the Ark...The Keep was made 2 years AFTER Raiders but the special FX in the movie are worse than one from a film in the 60's! from a military standpoint it was a letdown, very little equipment, weapons or tactics to examine. If you like the plot of this movie as I did but want to see a good film try the VHS Castle Keep starring burt Lancaster in which a small American unit defends a castle in Belgium from the advancing Nazi's during the Battle Of The Bulge. The VHS The Bridge which is about Hitler Youth defending a bridge in their hometown from an American attack is also a good alternative. I don't even think fans of Goth will find The keep particularly entertaining, they should check out the 1999 Christopher Lambert movie Beowulf which delivers everything that The Keep does not.", "timestamp": 988329600, "rating": 2, "sentiment": 0.0481648495537384, "overall": 4.620412123884346, "wordCount": 244, "customer": {"customerId": "A2TI67VB6TDWF5", "name": "Richard P.

That being said, this season has problems that a viewer could give a pass to in season one because it was new. Ichika returns as the clueless typical Japanese Anime male \"hero\". The problem is that his character type has been done to death in a hundred other anime. As I watched season 2, I found his character to be more and more grating and annoying. The rest of the cast is ok. I love Charlotte, I admit, and while I may not adore the entire cast, they are different enough to be enjoyable to watch on the screen. The problem is the lack of character development among the main cast returning from season 1. Ichika doesn't change at all. His reaction to the harem anime in which he is the center of simply isn't funny anymore. The viewer gets to see some fresh blood in a pair of sisters who join our happy band of awesome mech pilots, and they are also very fun to get to know episode to episode. The animation is amazing, the mech battles are fantastic. The plot is a mess. For every episode or piece of an episode we are given with plot development, we are then subjected to one or two episodes of pure fan service that do NOTHING for the overall story and serve only to show how painfully un-hilarious Ichika is with his clueless personality towards the other girls, as well as his not so covert admiration (obsession?) with his older sister.  Do not get me wrong, I like fanservice, I just don't want to drown in it.  I do hope there is as season 3, but if so, I hope they stick closer to the light novels and the intriguing plot and not so much on the girls wooing the clueless Ichika who really isn't that great of a mech pilot to begin with.", "timestamp": 1437523200, "rating": 3, "sentiment": 0.1811135794030531, "overall": 5.9527839485076335, "wordCount": 180, "customer": {"customerId": "A2VXS4BYS0SCNG", "name": "Jason Olin", "cluster": 0}, "product": {"asin": "B00MZ3X3UE", "title": "Infinite Stratos II", "brand": "Josh Grelle", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-3lpX4OeL.jpg", "price": -1.0, "categories": ["Boxed Sets", "Anime"], "avgRating": 4.515625, "avgSentiment": 0.4038188938701877, "avgOverall": 8.02517223467547, "reviewCount": 64}}, {"summary": "Good acting but took too long to tell story,.", "review": "it took too long to tell the story.

When the cowboys find out that Nacho's been killed by the lowlife (Dylan McDermott) running a racket smuggling young girls like Nacho's daughter into the US to work as slave labor in his rag factories, they're ready to open up an econo-sized can of whupass on the dude, his crew and anybody else who gets in their way.. . Sutherland plays it level-headed and cool to Harrelson's hilarious cocky redneck in the big city, and together they make a fine pair.. .

The scene with them ordering dinner at a five-star hotel will also leave many of you fellas rolling on the floor with laughter.  Nothing, however, beats the scene with Harrelson showing up at a fashionista soiree, encountering high end floozies and a couple of Euroqueen designers cruising to get him out of his longjohns.. .

Though he may not remain dead much longer. George A. Romero's seminal cult classic starts off in a somber tone with an ominous title sequence culminating with his own credit superimposed opposite an American flag. Ostensibly we're witness to a mundane annual trip to the gravesite of a half remembered pops. Johnny and Barbra are siblings, and the former preys on the latter's fear of her surroundings. \"They're coming to get you, Barbra!\" he insists. It's all in jest of course. Johnny means her no harm. As they depart, Johnny notices an intoxicated looking man lumbering about and exclaims, \"Look! There's one now!\". As the odd man comes closer he indeed does attack Barbra, and thus begins one of the genres most appealing outings..   Johnny is quick to assist in repelling Barb's attacker, engaging in a fists to cuffs with the gaunt creature. Johnny falls, cracks his head against stone granite, and lies prostate. Barbra's on her own. She decides to make a run for the car, and upon securing herself inside, realizes she hasn't the keys. Oh dear. The odd man isn't so lumbering that it takes him very long to reach Barbra in her steel prison, and soon he's bludgeoning the car's window with a brick. Our protagonist isn't catatonic quite yet however (though she occupies most her later screen time in this state), and she has sense enough to release the emergency  break. As she coasts down the dirt road, the odd man staggers after her in a fevered pursuit. The car makes an impromptu stop at the base of a tree, and Barb makes another dash out in this evermore peculiar world. This time she makes it to a more fortified locale, a farmhouse..   Once inside she makes an exploration of the premises. She discovers the phone is out and the owner(s) have a thing for taxidermy. Our heroine seems to be on the brink of a complete mental breakdown when Ben comes crashing in. Now about Ben, well, Ben's the man. He takes charge of the situation going immediately to work on further fortifying the farmhouse. He also relates to Barbra a rather strange occurrence concerning a group of  men, not dissimilar to Barbra's pursuer, who were terrorizing  people outside a diner. Barb's pretty out of it though, and begins to rave on about Johnny, and demands they go back to his rescue. Such a vehement frenzy she exudes that it behooves our hero Ben to smack her one for her own good..   Later, they discover more people. There are the Coopers; Harry, Helen, and there young daughter who's received a nasty bite from one of the ghouls. Also a young couple; Tom and Judy. They've holed up down in the basement. When Ben asks Harry why he hadn't come up when he heard the screaming, he insists he was unsure if it was of any use. \"For all we knew you could have been one of those things!\", he exclaims. Tensions run high as Ben claims command of the upstairs and Harry the basement. Both men have good ideas, but refuse to work together. Ultimately, this lack of  cohesiveness will lead to their doom..   Night of the Living Dead, much like it's two sequels, isn't so much about the zombies as it is about the relationships between people forced to band together. The farmhouse bunch form a sort of micro colony, and the actions of one effect the well being of them  all. It's also very much a product of it's time. Coming out in the same year that saw both the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert Kennedy, and with the war raging on, the movie is certainly indicative of it`s time. It also owes a great deal to Richard Matheson's novel \"I Am Legend\", which also deals with society upheaval..   Beyond that, and why it's truly so endearing, is it's great storytelling. The story unfolds slowly at first and then starts to rip along at a relentless pace. There are many scenes that induce audience participation. Rummaging the farmhouse for supplies, and waiting eagerly for the next T.V. or radio announcement. Then, contemplating the next move of action. The movie really has you becoming involved with the group. The horror elements are all there to, including one very grizzly scene involving a trowel. The films infamous final moments are indelible and certainly do much to solidify it's place in cinema history. Night of the Living Dead is really the beginning of a decade of genre classics. It's gorilla filmmaking style laid the tracks for such classics as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and it reminds us of a time when horror films were about a little more than just making you jump from your seat.", "timestamp": 1083542400, "rating": 5, "sentiment": 0.1168796109993293, "overall": 7.792199027498324, "wordCount": 425, "customer": {"customerId": "A1F0KYEBK2019R", "name": "S.
