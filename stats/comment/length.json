Like books, video games are a different sort of medium and when turned into movies are usually nothing more than cool bad movies. With that said, I was really surprised by RESIDENT EVIL.  I had never played the video game, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The movie uses film techniques and cliches borrowed from a host of other films, e.g. THE MATRIX, ALIENS, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD just to name a few. Yet, the movie sucked me in. I was enthralled by it. I got caught up in the action and the story and kept wanting it to go on.. There isn't much dialogue here and therefore the acting is limited to physical reactions, facial expressions, body movement, and action sequences. The movie starts off slow and confusing with the seemingly hodge-podge of scenes not making any sense. However, once the background to the film is given and after a few flashbacks are seen, things begin to fall into place.. The movie is classified as a horror movie. However, it's really more of an action/adventure or sci-fi movie with a little gore and for a horror movie the gore is rather tame.. I've read a lot of mixed reviews about people who have played the game. Some say it strays from the games plot, while others say (with the exception of character changes) stays pretty close to the original video game. I don't know.

This is not to be confused with an episode of the same title from the \"Jeff Miller\" (Tommy Rettig) years.. . This was the one where \"Timmy Martin\" (Jon Provost) and Lassie end up stranded in the Canadian wilderness courtesy of a hot air balloon gone astray. Along the way Timmy becomes ill, as I recall, and was cared for by an Eskimo or Indian. The cinematography was beautiful, and as a kid I have wonderful memories of the balloon sequences. The series' associate producer, Bonita Granville Wrather, had done special voiceover intros, and special color title and credit sequences were also done for this special episode, I believe. This episode was re-cut for theatrical release as \"Lassie's Great Adventure,\" but was still missing some footage from the TV showing.. . Another multi-part episode missing is the 3-part one in which The Martins (Ruth, Paul & Timmy) leave the farm for Australia, and Lassie in the care of their elderly farmer friend, \"Cully Wilson\" (portrayed by the terrific Andy Clyde, who was also \"Hopalong Cassidy\"'s original sidekick, as well as \"George McMichael,\" the foil to Walter Brennan's \"Grandpa McCoy\" on TV's \"The Real McCoys\"). Cully eventually becomes too ill to care for the collie and so Lassie winds up with her new master, forest ranger Corey Stuart. This transition episode would have been a nice addition to this golden anniversary edition as well.. . Another missing element, of which I've never seen any episodes but which I've heard positive things is \"The New Lassie,\" which featured a young Will Estes aka \"Will Nipper\" (now on NBC's \"American Dreams\" as a Vietnam soldier) as Lassie's boy master, as well as the re-appearance of Jon Provost as his \"Uncle Steve\" (in the show it is revealed that was his birth name before The Martins adopted him as \"Timmy\") for a few episodes. This series also re-introduced Tommy Rettig as \"Jeff\" and June Lockhart, as a remarried \"Ruth\" after Paul Martin's death, in single episodes. It's never been re-aired in the U.S. since its syndicated run, to my knowledge, and no episodes on home video have ever been released.. . There was also a Lassie tribute special shown back in the 1990s, which would make a nice bonus in a set of this type. That documentary included comments from the then-still-alive Clayton and Rettig, as well as Lockhart and Provost, among other players in the \"Lassie\" series.. . I agree with some others' comments here that a release by a major home video company should have state-of-the-art technology in re-mastered prints of episodes, and in this digital age there is just no good excuse for not having the best audio/video possible.. . Maybe what's really needed is a Lassie DVD box set, which would include the material on this 50th anniversary DVD set in enhanced format, and could also include the aforementioned omissions, and then some?

When watching a Quentin Tarantino film, there are a lot of familiar elements to be expected: An inventive pastiche of genres (often delivered with tongue firmly in cheek). Excessive, cartoonish violence. The use of iconic actors in often unexpected roles. Scenes full of clever, tense dialog that often end up exploding in brutality. And, if you look carefully, hidden beneath all the flash and stunts and gore, moments of genuine emotional resonance.. . By all this criteria, \"Django Unchained\" is typical Tarantino. What makes the film unique among his cannon, and so controversial, is its subject matter. After all, is there any more subject more taboo in modern America than race? And does anything stir up more complex and unresolved feelings among the races than by bringing up our country's shameful history of slavery?. . First and foremost, this film is extremely entertaining. I often get bored or impatient during long films, but not once during it's almost three hour running time did I check the time. It's thrilling, it's funny, it's clever, it's visually interesting and emotionally engaging. The story itself is really fairly straightforward: a bounty hunter (Christopher Waltz) frees a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), makes him his partner, and then agrees to help him free his slave wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio). It's not the plot, but the characters that make the film so fresh and engaging. Django, although the titular character, is probably the least interesting in the film. He's strong and stoic in the tradition of Clint Eastwood, and it is great fun watching him dole out justice, but he doesn't get any of the good dialogue. Dr. King Schultz, Django's mentor, probably carries the first half of the film. He's charming, verbose, calculating, and equally capable of great compassion and ruthless violence, depending on which he seems to think the situation calls for.. . The film's second half belongs to the dual villains of DiCaprio's Calvin Candie, a ruthless psychopath masquerading as a southern gentleman, and his house slave/Svengali Steven (Samuel L Jackson). The juxtaposition of the two despicable characters together drive home a subtle point: that slavery wasn't just about race, but about the dark, ruthless nature of human beings to want to control, dominate and subjugate other human beings. As entitled and evil as Candie is, Steven is just as willing to go to abhorrent lengths to maintain the status quo, because the status quo has afforded him as much power and control over others as he could possibly be allowed in his position.", "timestamp": 1357084800, "rating": 4.0, "sentiment": 0.0846153846153846, "overall": 6.711538461538462, "wordCount": 260, "customer": {"customerId": "A3HM5G9IV1FTFP", "name": "Douglas King", "cluster": 3}, "product": {"asin": "B005LAIIJY", "title": "Django Unchained", "brand": "Jamie Foxx", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZREoNuUyL.jpg", "price": 5.0, "categories": ["Genre for Featured Categories", "Action & Adventure"], "avgRating": 4.227208179494462, "avgSentiment": 0.2907632127934554, "avgOverall": 7.4541162114781, "reviewCount": 3521}}, {"summary": "Hallelujah !!!", "review": "What Would Jesus Buy? is an outstanding documentary of the very creative--and confrontational--tactics of \"Reverend\" Billy (Bill Talen). He organizes a gospel-style singing choir called the Church of Stop Shopping; and they perform songs and go on a major cross country bus tour to challenge people to re-think their attitudes about shopping in general--and especially to reevaluate the value of frenzied holiday shopping which pushes aside the real meaning of Christmas. The documentary flows at a very good pace; and I was never bored--their story is remarkable, true and rather dramatic. The cinematography is very professional and I felt that I was with them and knew what their experiences were like as I watched this DVD.. . For the better part of the film the focus is on two subjects. To a lesser degree, we meet several people who have spent so much that one of them can max out a new credit card in just one day and not show very real concern about it; and we meet a woman who has incredible amounts of clothing--for her Chihuahua. There are teens confessing that they'll be ostracized in school if they don't wear the latest fashion trends; and one woman uses Reverend Billy's mobile \"confessional\" booth to tell him how she had to destroy an article of clothing in a store dressing room because once she tried so hard to fit into it she couldn't get it off! She goes on to say that she couldn't go back into the store--where she shopped every day--unless she hid the fact that she couldn't fit into a dress, and having to destroy the dress just to remove it wasn't too much fun for her, either.. . However, the principle focus of the film is the group's one month cross country journey to go into shopping malls and ring people's doorbells to alert them to the \"Shopocalypse.\" For Reverend Billy and his followers the \"Shopocalypse\" comes when there's so much spending just before Christmastime that the rate of spending is irresponsible and threatens to destroy the true meaning of Christmas. Reverend Billy and the chorus hit the road in a rather old bus; and it is indeed ironic that the one road accident that befalls them happens when a truck rushing to get Christmas merchandise to stores rams into the back of their bus. Fortunately, no one gets hurt too badly and after a day or two they go on their way.. . But the culmination of the one month tour (which ends on Christmas Day in Disneyland) may have some consequences. In fact, just making it to their destination may have some problems for them. While they get some calm conversation time with a local merchant whose business has been ruined by Walmart, the group's appearances at several Walmart stores, a number of Starbucks franchises and The Mall of America are not exactly welcome. No spoilers here--watch and find out what happens!. . The DVD comes with some nice extras. We see footage of their \"send-off\" concert in Saint Mark's Church in Manhattan; there's a public access revival television spot made by Reverend Billy; and we learn the pitiful story of how China jailed a young woman for two years--all for the crime of being Christian. I also like the footage from their stop at a post office in Pennsylvania, too.. . What Would Jesus Buy may have been produced, shown in theaters and put on DVD before this huge recession started and spending did slow down, but the concept of getting people to shop less and be more fiscally responsible is timeless. For example, younger people on college campuses are easily lured into credit cards with high interest rates if they don't pay their bills in full right away; many of these people don't understand the real responsibilities of having a credit card--it creates a bill that you DO have to pay. In addition, I strongly agree with Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping that people have become so enamored with shopping that the true meaning of Christmas is in very real danger of being forgotten.

Part One - The Films & Changes. . \"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\". . It's very strange to finally be writing a review of these films on DVD. I don't think a single day has gone by in the eight years we've been running The Digital Bits that we weren't asked: \"When is Star Wars coming out on DVD?\" We've struggled to answer that question as best we could of course, constantly checking with both 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm. We've repeatedly tried to convince George Lucas himself to release these films on DVD, eventually succeeding in getting at least the prequel films on disc (after a LONG campaign with other websites in which we jointly collected over 30,000 signatures and took out a full page ad in Daily Variety). But as to the ultimate question of when Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi would be released on our favorite format, Lucasfilm's answer was always \"eventually\". Well... eventually has finally arrived, hard though it is to believe.. . The Star Wars Trilogy arrives on DVD in the form of a new 4-disc box set, containing not only the much-loved movies, but also a separate disc of all-new bonus material. So let's take a closer look, shall we? We'll start with the films themselves.. . As most of you know, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope tells the story of Luke Skywalker, a young farmboy living on a backwater planet with dreams escaping his humdrum plight for a life of heroism in outer space. It seems that the galaxy is embroiled in a massive civil war between the evil Galactic Empire and the freedom-loving Rebel Alliance. Luke longs to fight for what he believes in, but the conflict is raging a long way from his far-flung world... at least until a pair of bumbling droids suddenly arrives on his uncle's farm. Luke discovers that the droids are carrying a secret message from a Rebel princess, intended for a wizened Jedi Knight named Obi-Wan Kenobi, who happens to live nearby. The droids are also carrying the stolen plans for the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, a massive space station with enough firepower to destroy an entire planet. Unless these plans can be safely delivered to the Rebel forces, their struggle for freedom and justice will be crushed once and for all. So with the help of Kenobi and a wise-cracking pirate named Han Solo, Luke suddenly finds himself whisked away into deep space on the adventure of his life, pursued all the while by the Empire's most sinister agent of evil... Darth Vader.. . It's really unnecessary to say much more about this film, as you're all no doubt intimately familiar with it by now. Released as a lark in 1977 by 20th Century Fox, George Lucas' original Star Wars became a hugely successful blockbuster almost overnight and it quickly changed the landscape of Hollywood filmmaking, not only reviving a long-lost cinematic genre but also pioneering the field of movie visual effects. The film had an incalculable impact on my then ten-year-old life, opening my eyes to the possibilities of the film medium and firing my imagination like nothing before it. I'm certain that, like me, most of you have a very special place for the film in your hearts. But Star Wars today is somewhat different than you might remember it from 1977... or even the 1997 special edition re-release.. . As you may have heard, a number of new digital changes have been made to the Star Wars films for this DVD release. As with the 1997 special edition, A New Hope has received the majority of the attention. Many shots have been altered in very subtle ways, which only the most zealous fans will notice. There are, however, a number of more major changes. In A New Hope, these include a revised opening shot as Luke's landspeeder enters Mos Eisley Spaceport (the speeder model is more detailed and moves more naturally), an improved version of the Han/Greedo fight (Greedo still shoots first, but only just - the blasts are much closer together and Han's movement is smoother), a new CG model of Jabba the Hutt (it's a revised version of the Episode I model of the character and is much improved) and re-rotoscoped lightsaber blades throughout the film (blade color is more pronounced and the animation is more like the prequel films). Personally, I quite like most of these changes. The Han/Greedo fight is still less than perfect, but it does look more natural. Han's head doesn't jerk like it did before - instead his whole upper body shifts over slightly. And the blaster shots are VERY close together now, so the encounter is not as implausible as it was in 1997. I still wish George would just let Han shoot first as he did originally in 1977, but I can at least stomach watching this scene now.. . Three years after the release of the original film, Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back continued the epic adventure. After successfully destroying the Death Star, Luke and his Rebel friends have been pursued across the galaxy by Darth Vader and the Empire's mighty space fleet. While hiding out in a new secret base on the frozen planet of Hoth, the Rebels are discovered by Vader. After a massive snow battle, our heroes barely escape with their lives and are scattered across space. Luke finds his way to the jungle planet Dagobah, where he begins training to become a Jedi Knight. Meanwhile, Han and the princess find refuge on the planet Bespin, unaware that they've been followed by Vader's forces. Soon, Luke must abandon his training to come to his friends' rescue, ultimately risking his fate in a reckless confrontation with Vader himself.. . Widely considered to be the best of the Star Wars series, The Empire Strikes Back tells a much darker and more personal story than the original film, despite the inclusion of several dramatic action sequences. In a risky move, this unconventional sequel sees the good guys basically getting their asses kicked from the start of the film until the very end. It's not a happy or upbeat adventure by any means, and it ends with a stunning and unforeseen twist that left theater audiences hanging on the edge of their seats for more than three years after its original release in 1980. Despite the cliff-hanger ending (or perhaps because of it) Empire ranks easily among the best film sequels of all time. It holds up well to this day.. . The digital changes to Empire for this DVD release are fewer than they are in A New Hope. In fact, there are only three major changes. These include the use of Temuera Morrison as the voice of Boba Fett (which I suppose makes sense given that Boba is a clone of Jango from Episode II), the elimination of Luke's scream when he jumps to escape Vader on Cloud City (which had been a source of much debate among fans - why would he scream if he were jumping willingly?), and the use of actor Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor (replacing the old woman and voice actor Clive Revill who played the character originally). I should note that the Emperor alteration also involves a change in the scene's dialogue - one that is at first confusing. The Emperor now tells Vader that he has no doubt \"the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star\" is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker, to which Vader replies \"How is that possible?\" That doesn't seem to make sense, because we know that Vader is aware of who Luke is from dialogue earlier in the film (\"That's it. The Rebels are there. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.\"). I suspect, however, that we'll find out in Episode III that Anakin DOES learn of Luke's existence as an infant, and he hides this knowledge from the Emperor. What that would mean is that Vader's been waiting all these years to find Luke as an adult and turn him to the Dark Side so that they can overthrow the Emperor together - a plot Vader ultimately confesses to Luke at the end of Empire. We'll have to wait for Episode III to see how this new bit of dialogue fits in.. . Concluding the original trilogy in 1983, Episode VI - Return of the Jedi opens as Luke, now a fully trained Jedi Knight, returns with his friends to his home planet to rescue Han Solo from the vile crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Luke then revisits Dagobah and learns that he must ultimately confront Darth Vader if the galaxy is to have any hope of peace. Luke also learns a surprising secret before rejoining the Rebels as they prepare for the final, decisive battle in the conflict between Rebellion and Empire - an all-out assault on the Emperor's second and even more powerful Death Star.. . As the final chapter of the Star Wars saga, Return of the Jedi fails to be either as fresh as the original film or as surprising as Empire. Too much is predictable here (such as the appearance of a second Death Star) and too many compromises were made for the younger audience members (the very presence of the Ewoks, for example) which is especially noticeable after the more adult themes of the previous installment. That said, Jedi does manage to adequately complete the story arc of the original trilogy. There's nice symmetry with the way the character storylines are wrapped up, and there's enough action to keep the film interesting. I'll be curious to see how well this conclusion works in the context of the overall 6-film saga once Episode III arrives in theaters in May, 2005.. . As with Empire, are three major digital changes to Jedi, all of which appear at the end of the film. When Luke removes Vader's mask to reveal his father's face, the eyebrows of actor Sebastian Shaw have been erased (presumably because Anakin's face will be badly burned in Episode III). Then, after the second Death Star is destroyed, when the film cuts to the various celebrations around the galaxy, Naboo is now included among the planets we see. Finally (and this is a big one), when the Force ghosts of Ben, Yoda and Anakin appear to Luke at the very end of the film, actor Sebastian Shaw has been replaced with Hayden Christensen (as he'll appear in Episode III). That's going to piss off a lot of fans, but it makes sense. I suspect the rational is that a Jedi's Force ghost is frozen in appearance at the exact moment of his or her death. Since Anakin Skywalker basically ceases to exist in Episode III (becoming Darth Vader), his ghost remained at that age. Yeah, it's a stretch, but hey... within the logic of the universe, it does make sense. Like it or not.. . Ultimately, I've accepted that Lucas is entitled to change these films until he's happy with them. The fact is, he's been changing them since 1977 (for example, right after the first film was released and became a hit, Lucas quickly went back in and added the Episode IV - A New Hope tag). These new CG alterations are simply the logical continuation of his desire to overcome the technical challenges he faced when he originally made the films. I have to tell you, I'm as surprised as anyone to find myself actually appreciating most of these changes. With the sole exception of the Han/Greedo scene (which still bothers me, although less now than as it was in 1997), I think all of the changes are either genuine improvements or simply make sense given the ties to the prequel films. I still think Lucas has a responsibility to save the original versions of these films out of respect for the fans who have supported them all these years, the artists who creatively invested themselves in the original work, and as a way to remind us all just how far the films have come since they were first released. And I still have hope that we'll see those original versions released on disc... eventually... in a more elaborate box set of the entire saga. But more on that later.. . So that's the films as you'll find them on these new DVDs. Now let's talk about the DVDs themselves. Click to the next page of the review and I'll tell you all about it.. . Part Two - DVD Presentation Quality & Extras. . The most important part of any DVD presentation is the video and audio quality of the film itself. So how do the Star Wars Trilogy DVDs stack up in this regard?. . Simply put, the Star Wars films have never (and I mean EVER) looked this good before. The films presented on these discs absolutely sparkle, in all their anamorphic widescreen glory. The folks at THX and Lowry Digital worked for months to create new high-definition digital masters of these films, transferred directly from the original negatives. Once the films were transferred, painstaking efforts were made to clean the digital masters of dust, dirt, scratches and excessive grain. To give you an idea of just how much work was involved, more than 100 bits of debris were digitally removed from EACH FRAME - ultimately entailing the removal of over 10 million such blemishes in all over the three films combined. As a result, you will not find a single speck ANYWHERE on any of these films. The snow-white slopes of Hoth and the sand-baked dunes of Tatooine have never looked so pure.. . Because the transfers were done from the original negatives, you're going to see detail in these films that you've never seen before. You'll notice this right from the opening shot of A New Hope, when the Star Destroyer chases its quarry over the surface of Tatooine. Just look at the subtle swirl of could patterns on the planet below - astonishing. Best of all, not a lick of added edge enhancement was required to bring out this detail. What else is good? The color palette here is more lush and accurate than ever before. You're going to be blown away by everything from subtle flesh tones to the vibrant gold plating on C-3PO's chest to the bright orange flightsuits of the Rebel pilots. Contrast is also spectacular, with deep detailed blacks and clear, accurate whites. All three films in this set are just going to absolutely blow you away, and the bigger your screen the better it gets. The Star Wars Trilogy on DVD is the best excuse you're ever going to have to go out and buy yourself a good anamorphic widescreen display. Until true high-definition arrives, it just doesn't get better than this.. . On the audio side, all three films have been fully re-mixed in true Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX. The dynamic range in these mixes is impressive - everything from the softest passages of John Williams' signature score to the most explosive moments of action will full your home theater space with natural, immersive sound. The mixes are packed with atmospheric fill, active panning and surround play. The matrix-ed EX center back channel is nicely active - you'll definitely be glad you have an extra speaker back there, believe me. Dialogue is at all times clear and the LFE will really give your subwoofer a workout. These audio mixes are an absolutely appropriate match to the near perfect image quality. The sonic experience of these films on DVD will floor you.. . As with the previous DVDs for The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, each movie disc features there different menu sets themed to the various planets visited in the film. These appear at random when you boot up the disc (although there are codes you can use to see specific sets - see the Easter egg guide on the previous page).. . In terms of extras, each movie disc also features a full length audio commentary track with members of the cast and crew. For all three films, George Lucas provides his thoughts on the overall themes and concepts, as well as interesting anecdotes on the characters and production. Actress Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) chimes in as well with her thoughts and shares some particularly funny behind-the-scenes stories about working on the films. Sound designer Ben Burtt discusses his audio work and the creation of various sounds for each character, vehicle, prop and environment. And Dennis Muren addresses the elaborate special effects work. For the Empire commentary, director Irving Kershner joins this group to provide his insights on the making of the film. As with the The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones commentaries, the name of the person talking will occasionally appear at the top of the screen to help you identify them. I don't want to spoil anything here - you've all been waiting so long for these DVDs that it's just better for you to experience it all yourself. Just know that the commentaries are fascinating and absolutely worth listening to.. . The majority of the extras in this set are contained on its fourth disc, appropriately titled Bonus Material. This opens with an animated menu that depicts the Falcon flying through the asteroid field in Empire (you eventually end up in the Falcon's cockpit to make your selections). I should also note here that nearly every item on this disc is presented in anamorphic widescreen video - a very nice touch.. . Arguably the most important bonus feature on the disc is Kevin Burns' 151-minute Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy documentary. Burns was given full access to the expansive Lucasfilm Archives and was able to uncover hours of behind-the-scenes footage from the making of these films that you've definitely never seen before. The documentary begins with Lucas' original idea for the films, then covers the development, pre-production, filming and post-production of the original Star Wars in tremendous depth. Burns' idea was to take you back to 1977, to relive not only the struggle that was the making of the original film but also the film-going climate into which it was ultimately released. You are there are at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, waiting in line to see the film for the first time. You actually get to see the original version of the opening crawl, sans the Episode IV - A New Hope tag (and it will give you chills to see, believe me). You get to hear from absolutely everyone involved in the making of these films. Over 40 new, in-depth and original interviews were conducted with all the major cast members, the production staffers, etc. They're all here to give you their thoughts on the films.. . The first hour of Empire of Dreams is devoted exclusively to A New Hope, and then the remaining time is split between the making of Empire and Jedi. As I said, you're going to see things you never knew existed - footage of the cast clowning around on the set, a couple alternate versions of scenes from the films, plenty of production artwork and still photos - you name it. Irving Kershner tells a great story about how the secret of Luke's parentage was kept hidden from the cast, crew and fans. It's pretty amazing stuff. The documentary does drag a little bit once you get past the first hour, but you'll still enjoy every minute of it and you'll probably watch it more than once if you're a fan.. . Also on this disc are a set of three production featurettes. The Characters of Star Wars tells of the development of each character within the story and how each major role was cast. This includes some great, never-before-seen video of actors who tried out for the parts but didn't get them. Can you imagine Kurt Russell as Han Solo? Cindy Williams as Leia? William Katt (yeah... The Greatest American Hero) as Luke? It's fun stuff.. . The Birth of the Lightsaber addresses how the traditional weapon of the Jedi came to be. We get to see rare video of fight rehearsals and on-set raw footage (without the blades rotoscoped in). Ben Burtt tells you how he came up with the sound, etc. Again, good stuff.. . The Force is with Them: The Legacy of Star Wars looks at the influence the Star Wars films have had on Hollywood filmmaking (and filmmakers) as a whole. It features new interviews with the likes of Peter Jackson, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron and many others as they each talk about how the success of these films affected their careers and their work.. . Fans of Star Wars minutiae will be pleased to learn that a whole gallery of rare theatrical trailers and TV spots for each film has been included on this disc, each in anamorphic widescreen video and presented in quality you've never seen before. There are also galleries of original poster art for the films, as well as a gallery of rare production photos. The production photos are very cool to see, but they're also a little frustrating because they include images from many deleted scenes we've all been waiting to see for years. That's all fine and good... except none of these actual scenes are included on the disc. That's right - you will not get to see Luke and Biggs on Tatooine from A New Hope, the Wampa attack from Empire, or the sandstorm from Jedi. The fact that they're not here is deliberate and tells you something else - they've been held back for inclusion on a more elaborate special edition release of these films in the future (I actually have word from sources that Lucasfilm is already planning the high-definition box set of the whole 6-film saga, possibly for the original film's 30th anniversary in 2007). It shouldn't come as any surprise that more elaborate special editions will eventually be released, but I found the lack of deleted scenes here to be irritating and I think others will as well. It's a major strike against the extras on this set.. . There are three other cool extras on this disc you'll want to check out (and others many of you won't give a rip about). The cool stuff includes a long-awaited sneak peek at the forthcoming Episode III. This takes the form of a featurette on the return of Darth Vader. We get to see the production staff building the new Vader costume, actor Hayden Christensen talking about what it's like to don the familiar black helmet, and Christensen and co-star Ewan McGregor practicing the infamous lightsaber duel that will climax the film. I think it will get you sufficiently pumped for the last Star Wars film ever... at least enough to hold you over until November when the teaser trailer for the film will arrive in theaters.. . Speaking of trailers, as with the previous Star Wars DVDs, these discs include DVD-ROM weblinks to an exclusive online site where you may get the first look at additional footage from these films, the Episode III trailer, etc.. . The other cool extra is a nifty Easter egg hidden in the bonus disc's menus. Like the previous DVDs, \"1138\" is the code to unlock it. When you do this successfully, you'll be treated to a funny gag reel from the original Star Wars films (see the Easter egg guide on the previous page for instructions on how to access it). I should also note that two of the aforementioned production featurettes on this DVD have funny little moments during the credits that you'll enjoy as well.. . What's left on this disc is the not so cool, by which I mean the marketing fluff. This includes a trailer for the Star Wars Battlefront Xbox game and a preview teasing the making of the forthcoming Episode III videogame. I frankly don't care about either, but I suppose some of you out there will. It's also worth nothing here that if you put this disc on your Xbox machine, you'll get to play a complete preview level of Star Wars Battlefront. Again, I couldn't give a rip, but I'm sure some of you will appreciate this.. . So that's the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD, circa 2004. The films themselves definitely look and sound better than you've ever seen them before, and there are enough little (and not so little) tweaks and changes to each one to either thrill you or make you want to pull your hair out (or both). The extras on this 4-disc set are generally quite good, with the exception of the marketing material and the lack of deleted scenes. None of it is truly great, but it's certainly good and worthy of your time. Going through these extras, you definitely get the sense that what's been included here is just the tip of the iceberg, and that much more elaborate special editions of these films are likely to find their way to disc in the years ahead. Given the long wait to get these films on DVD... well, no DVD release could probably be equal to that level of anticipation. Still, with picture and sound quality like this, it's pretty easy to justify the purchase price for this set. Throw in the documentary and the audio commentaries, and it's really a no-brainer.. . After all my bitching and moaning about getting these films on DVD over the years... my occasional tantrums and frequent soap box proclamations... am I finally a happy Star Wars fan? You know, I don't even know what the words \"happy Star Wars fan\" mean anymore. But am I secretly giddy that I finally have these films on DVD? Yeah, I am. I hate myself a little for it, but such is the curse of Star Wars geeks everywhere. No matter how angry and jaded I get, I still get chills when that logo crashes across my screen and that familiar John Williams fanfare blares over my speakers. Yeah, I got a bit of the goosebumps when I found out that Episode III was going to be called Revenge of the Sith. And yeah, I'll go to whatever crap movie the Episode III teaser trailer is attached to just for a couple minutes of eXtreme geek-out time. Don't even try to pretend that a lot of you don't feel the exact same way. We're a pretty pathetic bunch aren't we?. . Anyway, I hope you all enjoy these DVDs. God knows you've waited long enough to get them.", "timestamp": 1095465600, "rating": 5.0, "sentiment": 0.1526067048893135, "overall": 7.881516762223284, "wordCount": 1317, "customer": {"customerId": "ACLBADVSU5K1K", "name": "Sympho", "cluster": 1}, "product": {"asin": "0793906091", "title": "Star Wars Trilogy THX Digitally Mastered Edition", "brand": "George Lucas", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41BeT-hHmTL.jpg", "price": 17.28, "categories": ["Science Fiction & Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Star Wars"], "avgRating": 3.986042034333386, "avgSentiment": 0.2995776230537713, "avgOverall": 7.234986091967816, "reviewCount": 6233}}, {"summary": "A GREAT TEAM, BUT...THE GREATEST???", "review": "Hopefully, they will continue to release these NBA Finals series on DVD.  Unfortunately, they usually cut the championship celebration coverage a little bit short, as well as the introduction to several games.  For those interested in my opinion of where this team ranks with the greatest of all-time, read below.. . When discussing historic NBA teams, many Boston fans and sports writers most always consider the 1985-86 Celtics team as the greatest of all-time.  This is a topic they are quite confident and boastful about.  The team that they are usually the quickest to compare them to is the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, who have now become a measuring stick on nearly every sports channel when NBA teams accomplish some type of significant progress for victories during various portions of a season.  It seems safe enough for some Celtics fans to accept OTHER teams being ranked ahead of them on the various polls and trendy lists of all-time greatest champions over the years.  But when it comes to the Bulls being ranked ahead, they usually become very critical.  Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe once said \"had it only occured to the Celtics that they could have won 70 games, they would have done it (been the first to do it)...not those Bulls teams\".  Were the Celtics not aware of how many games were scheduled?  Other Boston fans have said similar statements (\"if the Celtics had not been so bored...\").  Poor Danny Ainge was a TNT broadcaster at the time of the '96 Bulls phenomenal run, having to give constant credit to them for every blowout win the station televised.  But after being asked by Verne Lundquist during one particular telecast if that particular team was as good as his Celtics teams, Ainge quickly denied the thought and gave no reason why.  When Bill Walton was asked to compare the two teams he said \"granted, Michael Jordan is a pretty good player, but Dennis Johnson is a player that you wanted on your team if you were going into a big game\" (the same Dennis Johnson that went 0 for 14 as leader of the Sonics in Game 7 of the NBA Finals).  To sum up such arrogant and, need I say, ridiculous statements from some Boston fans and former players, they sound a little jealous.. . Before any debates even begin, nobody on that Celtics team, or any team from that era, had anyone that came CLOSE to containing Michael Jordan for very long.  Even the Bad Boy Pistons of '88 and '89, in both the regular season and playoffs, allowed him to average 30.8 points against them which would include giving up a 59 point game effort on Detroit's home court along the way.  In the first two games of the playoffs, Jordan scored 112 points against the '86 Celtics - 56 points a game.  That was done by a 2nd year player returning from a broken foot injury, on a terrible Bulls team (with 37 less wins than Boston) against the so-called \"greatest team ever\".  That same miserable Bulls team was even able to defeat the Celtics during the regular season.  Boston's trio of Parish, McHale and Bird is considered the greatest front line of all-time yet they were overmatched in offensive rebounds during that season vs. the struggling Bulls.  Celtics fans argue that their Hall of Fame big men would be much too difficult of a matchup for the '90s Bulls and would \"dominate\" them.  But in the years following the '86 season, a time when the Celtics were now facing the \"Jordan/Pippen\" Bulls, Boston's front line who was even productive offensively against its regular season opponents still could not shake Chicago, splitting the season series with them every time.  Remember that this was before the Bulls were even close to being a championship team.  Rookie Scottie Pippen who came off the bench that season totalled more points against the Celtics front line than he did against any other opponent that year.  Actually if you compare Pippen and Bird in head to head matchups during the short number of years they faced each other, Scottie's numbers are very comparable.  No, Bird wasn't old yet.  Larry was still averaging career highs in points and assists during 3 of those seasons and Scottie was just starting out in minutes played, experience and most definately his championship quality of play.  Yet vs. each other in 14 contests:. Points per game - Bird 25.9, Pippen 19.5 (Scottie still outscored him 5 times). Rebounds per game - Bird 8.3, Pippen 4.9. Assists per game - Pippen 2.4, Bird 1.0. Field Goal % - Pippen .530, Bird .503. 3 Point % - Pippen .530 (much better than his .250 vs. everyone else at that time), Bird .450. Blocks per game - Pippen 0.7, Bird 0.6. Turnovers per game - Bird 3.4, Pippen-only 1.9. So, to discuss what WOULD HAVE happened against a Jordan/Pippen Bulls team that was finally in CHAMPIONSHIP form is useless, since it never happened.  It's not safe to assume what would have or what could have happened in any contest that's never been seen since there have been so many upsets in sports over the years.  There are easier ways to judge how the 1986 Celtics stand historically against teams like the '96 Bulls, as well as other past champions.  I have broken things down into numerous categories.  By the way, these are not MY stats.  These are official NBA stats available for anyone to research:. . REGULAR SEASON RECORDS:  There are 6 other championship teams in NBA history with equal or better records than the '86 Celtics who had 67 wins - The '96 Bulls (72 wins), '72 Lakers (69 wins), '97 Bulls (69 wins), '67 76ers (68 wins), '92 Bulls (67 wins) and the '00 Lakers (67 wins).. . PLAYOFF RECORDS:  The '86 Celtics went 15-3 in the post season.  There are other past champions with equal or better records.  The '01 Lakers went 15-1.  The '89 Pistons, '91 Bulls and '99 Spurs all went 15-2.  The '87 Lakers and '96 Bulls both went 15-3.  Though not as many rounds were played, the '71 Bucks went 12-2 and swept the Finals.  The '72 Lakers went 12-3.  The '83 Sixers were 12-1 and swept the Finals.  Even less games were played during earlier eras, but of note:  The '50 Lakers went 10-2, and the '61 and '64 Celtics lost only 2 games (8-2).. . HOME AND AWAY RECORDS:  The 1986 Celtics had a 40-1 home record which is outstanding (Several other teams had only 2 losses.  The '53 Lakers also had only 1 loss but played 10 less games).. However, it is more difficult to win on the road.... 15 other championship teams had better road records than the '86 Celtics. This includes the '67 and '83 Sixers, '71 Bucks, '72 and '87 Lakers, '92, '96 and '97 Bulls, as well as a couple of other Boston teams from the past.  Plus, the Celtics were only 5-3 on the road during the playoffs that year.. . COMPETITION:  This is what is talked about most often when comparing the '86 Celtics to other eras, particularly the '90s when Chicago dominated.  Boston fans pick on the Bulls due to the expansion that occured during that decade and give no credit to Chicago's accomplishments because of this.  By that logic, sports teams could have PERFECT regular season and playoff records, but would NEVER be given as much credit as any team that came before expansion occured.  When the '07 Patriots were on the verge of possibly making history with the most wins of all-time and a perfect season, no one, including members of the '72 Dolphins, was doubting this team's place as the greatest, or at least tied for the greatest ever.  This is an obvious double standard.  The NFL has even more teams than the NBA due to expansion.. The competition was probably better overall in '86, but was it really THAT much better?  In 1996 the league's shooting percentage was 46%.  But in 1986 it was only slightly better at 48%.  In fact, the '90s was the second best shooting decade in the history of the NBA.  So where are the FACTS about all of the superior hot shooting the league had back in the '80s compared to the '90s?. In 1986 there were only 4 other teams in the eastern conference with winning records.  That means that MORE than half of the teams in Boston's conference were LOSING teams.  In 1996 MORE than half of the teams in the Bulls' conference had WINNING records.  Also in '86, there were only 10 teams in the entire NBA with winning records.  In '96 there were more (14).  It's ironic that Boston fans make fun of Chicago's competition because of the 6 expansion teams that were added between '86 and '96.  Three of those teams had a better record than one of Boston's playoff opponents in '86.  And other than Philadelphia, 4 of those new teams had better records than anyone else in Boston's division in '86.. What about the top teams?  There were more teams that won over 50 games in 1996 than there were in '86.  In addition, there were 2 other teams (besides Chicago) to win over 60 games in '96.  The Bulls defeated both of them in the playoffs.  In 1986 there was only 1 other team to win at least 60 games, but Boston did not face them in the playoffs.. How about Finals competition?  It took the '86 Celtics 6 games to defeat the Houston Rockets, who won a whopping 16 less games than Boston during the regular season.  That's the 2nd largest difference in wins between 2 teams in an NBA Finals series over the past 30+ years.  The only series worse than that over that many years was the '81 Finals, when Boston faced a below .500 team with 22 less wins.  How is that considered SUPERIOR competition?. The 1996 Bulls defeated a 64 win Seattle team in 6 games.  Never before or since have 2 teams with better records matched up in an NBA Finals.  Chicago then beat the Jazz the following year, who also won 64 games and shot .504 from the field (nearly identical to the '86 Celtics).  That Jazz team also holds the NBA record for most wins in the second half of a season, continuing to gain momentum in the playoffs.. Okay, what about the argument that Boston's eastern conference was always so much tougher than what the Lakers had to face in the west each year?  During the entire decade of the 1980s, there were only 3 seasons in which the east had more winning teams than the west.  Half of the times that the Lakers appeared in the western conference finals, they played a team with a better or nearly equal record than one of the opponents in the eastern finals..  The eastern conference also became much more physical and better defensively starting in the late '80s and into the '90s.  Is it coincidence that Boston began to get injured and started fading when teams like the Pistons and Knicks began to rise?. The topic of the high number of individual all-stars that Boston had to face in the '80s compared to the '90s is also brought up frequently by their fans.  This is another lie.  Yes, during the 1980s the Celtics did have to face several players that made all-star teams, especially during the playoffs - 57 of them as a matter of fact.  However, the Bulls faced 70 all-stars during the playoffs in the '90s.  Contrary to popular Boston belief, there have been quite a few seasons where a roster FULL of all-stars was defeated in the playoffs by teams with only a couple of all-stars.  Just ask teams like the '75 Warriors or the '77 Blazers how many all-stars, or hall of famers for that matter, they needed on their roster to win the world championship.  Celtics fans are quick to point out how many hall of famers their 80's teams had, but hardly ever mention the number of rings they won.  That may be because those players come up short when compared to the opponents they dislike so much.  The players on the '86 Celtics had only half the number of rings (26) compared to the careers of the members of the '96 Bulls (52). The ring is the thing, not how many of the players on your squad made an all-star team at some point in their career (an accomplishment that is VOTED on).  So if the greatness of a player like Bill Russell is measured mainly by the first thing to come out of the fans' mouths - the number of rings he has, then by that same set of rules, Bird & company have some explaining to do if the nucleus of their team is considered the very BEST.. Finally, there is the dominant center theory.  How could teams like the Bulls, without a dominant center, ever beat those Celtics teams?  Boston fans repeatedly ask this question.  It's the same type of old school theory that once claimed that any team without a dominant center could never win an NBA championship.  Well, what about some of the teams that played Boston so well in the 1980s?  How about the starting center for the Sixers who knocked Boston out of the playoffs in '80 and '82?  Caldwell Jones, who made 2 All-Defensive 1st teams, never made an NBA All-Star team - an accomplishment Boston fans hold to the highest standard.  Luc Longley, the Bulls' starting center for their second three-peat, was taller than Caldwell, outweighed him, outscored him, and amazingly did just as well statistically in the defensive categories.  What about Tree Rollins, the Hawks' starting center when they pushed Boston to 7 games in 1988 (when the Celtics still had the best record in the east)?  Longley was taller, outweighed him, outscored him, and was nearly identical or better in every other statistical category.  Even forward/center Kevin Willis who also started for the Hawks that season (and eventually made 1 all-star team), had no OVERALL statistical advantage (during that particular season) over a center like Longley.  What was Boston's reason for having to come back from a 3-2 deficit in that series against centers with Longley-like production?  There were no injuries and Boston won games 6 and 7 by only 2 points.  Former NBA greats like Bob Lanier, who were at the end of their careers, were still able to start at center for teams that defeated Boston in the playoffs (Bucks/1983).  Longley's points per game during his 3-peat years were less than a point shy of Lanier's efforts that year.  And Luc was as good as or better in all other statistical categories too.  Look at another Bulls center like Dave Corzine.  He was nearly the lowest scoring starting center in the NBA in 1988, but the Bulls still split the season series with Boston.. . SUCCESS AGAINST RIVALS & OTHER TEAMS THAT WERE IN THEIR PEAK:  Great teams are sometimes measured by how well they faired against other competitive teams that were also in their prime.  The 1986 Celtics did not have to face any of the other championship franchises from that decade during the playoffs.  Yet, it's Boston fans who find fault in teams like Chicago and make claims that the Bulls never defeated any other heavyweights on their way to a title.  The best team that the '86 Celtics faced in the playoffs was the Milwaukee Bucks who were a consistently good team, but one that never advanced past a conference finals during that era.  When Boston did have to face those other teams that won titles during any other year in the playoffs during the '80s, look at how they did:. L.A. Lakers-  They beat Boston 2 out of 3 times in the Finals that decade.  In fact, during the entire Magic vs. Bird era, the Lakers won the overall matchup 25 games to 18.. Philadelphia 76ers- During the Sixers' peak ('80 to '83), they faced Bird's teams 3 times.  Philadelphia won 2 out of those 3 times even though Boston had home court advantage every time.  It took a 1 point, game 7, home court victory for Boston to beat Philly the one year they did.  In 1983 Boston could not advance far enough to even play the Sixers.  This was because the Celtics were swept by the Bucks, a team with the nearly equivalent production of a Luc Longley at center, despite having home court advantage again.  Boston finally won, convincingly, against a good Sixers team in '85, but one that had aged and was past their prime.. Detroit Pistons- During the Pistons' peak (roughly '87 to '91), Boston lost 3 out of 4 times to them, despite having home court advantage again twice.. Plus, the only times the Celtics did beat one of those teams, while those teams were in their peak years, it took them a full 7 games to do it.. So, when reviewing the competition that the 1980s Celtics beat in order to advance to or win an NBA Finals series, it wasn't as impressive as some may suggest:. -In the 1981 Finals, the Celtics took 6 games to beat a Houston Rockets team with a LOSING record.  And besides, wasn't the \"other\" competition in the west supposed to be so much easier?. -In the 1984 Finals, the Celtics beat the Lakers in 7 games (The Lakers actually beat themselves.  They held leads in the final seconds of 2 games, simply having to run out the clock in one of them, then stupidly threw the ball away).  However, that Lakers team had by far the worst record of ANY Magic Johnson Lakers team to advance to an NBA Finals series.. -In 1985 Boston did beat a good Sixers squad to advance to the championship round.  The Celtics had home court advantage again in the Finals though, and still lost to the Lakers, including the clinching game in Boston Garden.. -In the 1986 Finals, Boston took 6 games to beat another one-hit wonder Rockets team, winners of 16 less games than the Celtics (only 2 of those Rockets were on the roster in '81).  Houston was just above .500 again the following season.. -In 1987 Boston advanced again to the Finals, by beating a good second place Pistons team (not in Boston's division) in 7 games.  But again, it took a bad mistake by the other team to help Boston advance (Isiah's pass without calling time-out).. Some of the other great championship teams have defeated more notable opponents than the '86 Celtics.  The '67 76ers defeated the 8-time defending champion Celtics in 5 games.  The '72 Lakers defeated the defending champion Bucks, who still finished with 63 wins.  Three '80s Lakers teams defeated the defending champions in the playoffs.  The Sixers and Pistons of the '80s also beat defending champions to get their rings.  The Bulls also swept the 2-time defending champion Pistons on the way to their first title.. If you're thinking \"well, what about the other opponents during the '90s that the Bulls faced?\", remember:. Teams like the New York Knicks, Seattle Supersonics, Phoenix Suns, Utah Jazz, Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat and Orlando Magic ALL had the best records in the HISTORY of their franchises while they faced the Bulls in the playoffs, but the Bulls won every time (in 6 games or less).  Plus, some of their other opponents like Portland were in 2 NBA Finals in 3 years and had a franchise and league best 63 wins the year in between, and the Lakers had played in 8 of the previous 11 Finals.  And to those who criticize Chicago for winning during an era with no other \"championship\" teams to challenge them, did it ever occur to those people that the Bulls were just that dominant?  What about the Celtics of the '60s?  How many other champions did they have to face during the majority of their first 8 titles?  This is another double standard.. . OFFENSE:  The 1980s were simply a different era of basketball.  Indeed, it was very exciting to watch.  But overall it was an offense first, defense second mentality.  The entire league's averages were up.  Eras go through different stages though.  Nearly 20 years earlier the LOWEST scoring team in the league had a higher scoring average than the 1986 Celtics.  Even since the '96 Bulls, the scoring averages continued to decrease and have now gone back up again.  Eras change but the players can still adapt to the style.. -Points per game:  The 1986 Celtics scored 114.1 points per game.  There were 14 other championship teams that beat Boston out in that category, including every Lakers title team from '72 to '87.  The '67 76ers lead the list with 125.2 points per game.  Only twice did a Larry Bird-Celtics team even finish in the league's top 3 in ppg.. -Offensive Rating (available since 1977-78 season):  This is how many team points were scored per 100 possessions.  The '86 Celtics are 9th on the list of NBA champions at 111.8 (they were only 3rd in the league).  The '87 Lakers are #1 on the list (1st in the league).  5 out of the 6 Bulls championship teams (who were also #1 in the league) are also ahead of the '86 Celtics.. -FG Percentage:  The '86 Celtics, for as great as their front court was, rank only 8th all-time in field goal percentage for a championship team.  The '85 Lakers are #1.  In fact, all of Magic Johnson's title teams rank in the top 10.  The '91 and '92 Bulls also rank ahead of the '86 Celtics.  And it looks like teams after the Magic/Bird era COULD shoot after all.  8 title teams from 1990 and after are in the top 25 best shooting teams of ALL the 60+ NBA champions.. -3 Pt. Shooting:  The 3-point line was not brought into the NBA until the 1980 season and was not used very often at first.  So we'll never know how much this would have affected the success of some of the earlier great teams and games that did without it.  The '86 Celtics rank 12th all-time for championship teams in 3 point percentage.  Their rival, the Lakers from '87, rank ahead of them at #6.  But the #1 championship 3 point shooting team of all-time is the '96 Bulls, the only championship team to shoot over .400 for a season.  Three of those '96 Bulls, who shot regularly from the perimeter, had a better percentage than any of those '86 Celtics including Bird himself.  And though Larry was thought of as the 3 point shooting champion, an even more amazing fact is that 5 of those '96 Bulls players had better CAREER 3 point shooting percentages than Bird.. -Offensive Rebounding (This stat has been kept since the 1973-74 season):  Only 8 out of the 34 championship teams since this stat has been kept, have fired the ball up more than the '86 Celtics.  The '85, '87 and '88 Lakers didn't even shoot that much.  You would think that the '86 Celtics would have more offensive rebounds to get with so many more shot attempts, especially with having a worse field goal percentage than Magic's teams and some of those Bulls teams.  But get this...The '86 Celtics rank only #24 out of those other 34 title teams in offensive rebounds.  All of Magic's Lakers and all of Jordan's Bulls championship squads are among the many that had more offensive rebounds than those Celtics.  The '93, '96 and '98 Bulls, as well as the '82 Lakers are all among the top 10 teams.. -Turnovers (this stat has been kept since the 1973-74 season):  Something that is almost always mentioned about the '86 Celtics is how well they handled and passed the ball.  But, 21 championship teams (since this stat has been kept) have all turned the ball over fewer times than Boston in '86.  The '92 Bulls lead the list in fewest turnovers, with the other 5 Bulls championship teams in the top 10.  All 3 Pistons, and all 4 Spurs championship squads also had fewer turnovers per game than those Celtics.. -Frontcourt/Backcourt:  Parish, McHale and Bird in '86 had the all-time highest scoring starting frontcourt for a championship team (63.2 combined points per game).  The next best was the '71 Bucks -Kareem, Smith and Dandridge (61.8 ppg).  Hardly anyone talks about the best backcourts in NBA history though.  Boston ranks with some of the lowest championship teams ever in this category offensively.  Over 40 other starting backcourts from championship teams scored more points per game than Boston's in '86.  Ainge and D.Johnson scored a combined 26.3 points per game.  But, look at how they did compared to the #1 scoring backcourt of all-time.  West and Goodrich on the '72 Lakers scored a combined 51.7 points per game.  The next best was Jordan and Armstrong on the '93 Bulls (44.9).. . DEFENSE:  As mentioned earlier, once teams like the Pistons began to dictate the style of play due to their team DEFENSE (not offense), the league adjusted.  Since the scoring went down a little in the 90s but the shooting percentages were not that far off from the 80s, it only suggests that the defense was much better.. -Points allowed per game:  In '86, Boston finished 3rd in the league by allowing 104.7 points per game.  But, 36 out of the other 60 championship teams in NBA history all allowed fewer points than the '86 Celtics.  Only one other time did a Bird-Celtics team finish in the league's top 3 defensively.. -Defensive Rating (available since 1977-78 season):  This is points allowed per 100 possessions.  The '86 Celtics are only 14th on this list.  The '99 Spurs are #1, while their other 3 championship teams make the top 10.  Teams like the '83 Sixers and '96 Bulls are also ahead of the Celtics in this category.. Actually, only 3 times did the '80s Celtics have a player that made the NBA's 1st All-Defensive Team.  Kevin McHale and Dennis Johnson both made that team in '87.  But look at the other championship franchises in the '80s.  The Lakers had someone nearly every year from '80 to '88 (7 times).  The Sixers had a 1st Team All-Defensive player for 7 straight seasons.  During four of those seasons they had at least 2 players on the list, and in '83 there were 3 Sixers to receive that honor.  Detroit had 2 1st Team All-Defensive players in both '89 and '90.  How do they compare to the Bulls?  The Bulls had someone on that list for 11 straight seasons ('88-'98).  BOTH Jordan and Pippen were 1st Team All-Defensive players in '92, '93, '96, '97, and '98.  In '96 though, they actually had 3 players to receive the honor (Rodman was the other).  So, in 1996 the Bulls had 3 out of the top 5 defensive players in the NBA.. -Defensive Shooting Percentage:  Since this stat has been kept starting in the 1970-71 season, 26 teams have held their opponents to a lower shooting percentage than those '86 Celtics.  4 out of the 6 Bulls championship teams are among the many that rank ahead of Boston.. -Defensive Rebounding:  Boston fans should be happy to know that the '86 Celtics rank #5 since this stat has been kept, starting in the 1973-74 season.  But wait a minute...25 out of those other 34 teams ALLOWED fewer shot attempts from their opponents.  Put it in perspective.  The '86 Celtics had 4.2 more defensive rebounds per game than the '96 Bulls, but allowed 1,048 more shot attempts.. . TOTAL REBOUNDS: This may be hard to believe about Boston's \"greatest frontline in NBA history\" from '86.  But, Chicago's starting frontcourt of Longley, Rodman and Pippen averaged more rebounds per game than them in '97 (That same frontline from Chicago averaged less than 1 rebound per game shy of Boston's frontline in '96 and '98 also).  With over 220 more shots missed by Boston and their opponents in '86, along with Boston's highly praised Hall of Fame dominance at those positions, you would think Boston would have a DECISIVE advantage over Chicago's frontline in that category.  More myth.  In fact, more than 20 other starting frontcourts from title teams outrebounded the one from Boston in '86.  There were more than 20 other championship clubs that outrebounded the '86 Celtics as a team.. . POINT DIFFERENTIAL AND AVERAGE MARGIN OF VICTORY:  When judging who the most dominant single season teams of all-time were, you obviously would start by looking at teams that won the championship.  Then, you probably have to look at the teams that had at least sole possession of the best record in the league and what their records were (some were listed in the first category).  After that, you could look at how much they dominated the rest of the league each night.  Point differential is the difference between points scored and points allowed.  The 1986 Celtics are tied for 6th on this list of champions with a point differential of +9.4 points per game.  The '67 76ers had the same number.  The '71 Bucks (+12.2), '72 Lakers (+12.3), '92 Bulls (+10.4), '96 Bulls (+12.2), and '97 Bulls (+10.8) all had better point differentials than the '86 Celtics.. Then, there is the average margin of victory.  The '86 Celtics are only tied for 13th on this list with a 13.0 point avg. margin.  Actually, 3 other Celtics teams from the '60s are ahead of them. The '71 Bucks are #1 on the list (17.5).  The '72 Lakers, '87 Lakers, '96, '97, and '92 Bulls are all in the top 10.. . STAYING POWER:  This is the least important factor, especially when discussing what a team did in a SINGLE season.  But it helps to support the argument of how long a great team could last.  The Celtics of the 1980s were always one of the top teams, but never repeated as champions.  Bill Russell's Celtics obviously top this category.  There were also 6 other eras of teams that won either 2 or 3 consecutive championships - the Lakers of the '50s, '80s and of this decade, the Bulls, Pistons, and even the Houston Rockets.  When one takes into consideration what was at stake - the pressure to win 70 games and an NBA title - no other NBA team has ever been placed in the position that the '96 Bulls were in and been able to live up to every expectation.  Then, that same core of players remarkably won 2 more in a row.. While on the subject of staying power (if I can be allowed to have at least one \"could have\" or \"would have\" moment), it would been extremely difficult for the '86 Celtics to stay together for very long in the same era as a team that existed even 10 years after them - like the '96 Bulls.  Let's just say, for fun, that those same Celtics played in 1988 instead of 1986.  By the same set of rules as the Bulls and everyone else, Boston would have had to give up one of it's quality players in the expansion draft before the '89 season.  Then, there was another expansion draft for Jordan and company to go through prior to the '96 season when they lost B.J. Armstrong.  Next, free agency would have had to be dealt with.  The '96 Bulls, on the other hand, would have benefited from playing back in 1986 with not only added depth, but possibly added starters by not having to deal with expansion drafts.  Just something to think about if one were to claim that ALL teams could last in ANY \"era\".. . In summary, the 1986 Boston Celtics were truly ONE of the NBA's greatest teams.  I guess the question is though, why have some fans declared this particular team as the SINGLE greatest in history?  What do they base that on?  Saying \"coulda, shoulda, woulda\" in regards to missed opportunities (like winning 70 games), and bragging about matchups we'll never see does not hold up very well for Celtics fans.  There are several other teams with nearly equal or better accomplishments (* indicates a better feat than the '86 Celtics):. What about the '67 76ers? -68 wins*, 2 home losses and only 8 road losses*, +9.4 point differential, #1 all-time ppg. for an NBA champion*.. How about the '72 Lakers? -69 wins*, only 7 road losses*, longest winning streak in NBA history-33 games*, longest road winning streak (16 games)*, led the league with 121.0 ppg*, largest point differential of any NBA champion*, 2nd largest margin of victory in NBA history*, 12-3 in the playoffs.. Nobody talks about the '71 Bucks. -66 wins, led league with 118.4 ppg*, tied for 2nd largest point differential of all-time*, largest average margin of victory in NBA history (17.5)*, only 2 home losses, only 13 road losses*, only 2 losses in the playoffs*, swept the Finals*, 3rd longest winning streak in NBA history*.. Look at the '83 Sixers -65 wins, only 1 loss in the playoffs*, swept the defending champions in the Finals*, only 11 road losses*, 3 1st Team All-Defensive players*.. What about the Lakers of the '80s?  The '87 Lakers for example, are often thought of as the best -65 wins, 15-3 in playoffs, 117.8 ppg*, #4 all-time for NBA champions in FG%*, #1 all-time offensive rating*, 6th all-time in average margin of victory*, only 13 road losses*.. Then there's the '90s Bulls.  Just look at the '96 team for starters -72 wins-most in NBA history*, only 2 home losses, most road wins in NBA history*, 15-3 in playoffs, tied for 2nd all-time in point differential*, 5th all-time in average margin of victory*, longest home winning streak-44 games (dates back to end of previous season)*, #1 3 pt. shooting championship team in history*, defeated a team tied for the winningest Finals (losing) opponent in history*, #8 all-time for fewest turnovers for a champion*,  3 1st Team All-Defensive players*.. These are just a few of the teams and achievements that deserve to be mentioned on the list. It's very hard to compare eras anyway, especially the oldest decades. There are too many factors that seperate each era.  After listening to many Boston fans though, the facts don't support their opinions.  Webster's dictionary defines the word \"legend\" as a story or body of stories handed down for generations and popularly believed to have a historical basis.

It has given me much pleasure over the last decade and I have no hesitation pronouncing it THE best DVD purchase I have EVER made (and thats coming from somebody who buys a lot!). The box consists of 4 duel cases which have all been released separately, each one containing one jidaigeki (period drama) and one gendaigeki (modern day drama). Not only have all the prints of the films been beautifully remastered, transferred flawlessly and look absolutely exquisite, but each disc comes with informative video introductions by Tony Rayns and hefty booklets. The booklets include articles on the films by Keiko I. McDonald and Mark Le Fanu (authors of authoritative books on the director) in addition to English translations of the source material for all the jidaigeki we are given. Those into cover design will also enjoy the original colorful Japanese posters for all the films on the reverse of each inlay card. The presentation really couldn't be bettered and I recommend you get the 8 DVD box as all 8 films are unmissable for anyone who cares about film as an art-form. If you cant get the box then you can pick the 4 cases up individually. As I write I notice that both the box and the cases are all currently very expensive, sure sign that MoCs license has run out. Best buy now before they disappear forever. I notice some of the titles are available for streaming into your computer, but the quality of the image won't be the same and you would be denying yourself the fabulous documentation that comes with the MoC discs.. . The third case consists of Uwasa no Onna and Chikamatsu Monogatari, the fifth and sixth films Mizoguchi made for Daiei. Uwasa no Onna is a beautifully crafted and engrossing gendaigeki about the relationship between a brothel owning mother and her daughter who struggles to escape the disrepute that clouds her family name. Chikamatsu Monogatari is an extremely polished jidaigeki conflation of an early 18th century joruri puppet play by Chikamatsu Monzaemon called The Almanac of Love with a late 17th century short story by Ihara Saikaku on the same material called What the Seasons Brought the Almanac Maker. The film is a tragic/triumphant story of forbidden love and features some of the most beautiful and moving scenes Mizoguchi every directed. Underrated by Western critics (including Tony Rayns here), the film is celebrated by many in Japan as one of his most perfect achievements. The booklet contains excellent articles on both films (McDonald on Uwasa and Le Fanu on Chikamatsu) along with full English translations of the Chikamatsu and Saikaku source material. I review both films in what follows. Please note these are thematic reviews in which spoilers are inevitable.. . UWASA NO ONNA (The Woman in the Rumour, aka The Woman of Rumour). (1954, Japan, 84 min, b/w, English subtitles, Aspect ratio: 4:3, Audio: Mono). From 1952 to 1954 Mizoguchi was at the peak of his career, winning awards three years in a row at the Venice Film Festival for his renowned jidaigeki, The Life of Oharu, Ugetsu Monogatari and Sansh Day. Lauded by the critics of Cahiers du Cinma and by critics at home (albeit for different films and different reasons), the director could quite justifiably see himself on top of the world at this time. 1954 in particular was an extraordinarily busy year which saw the completion of three films, Uwasa no Onna sandwiched between Sansh Day and Chikamatsu Monogatari. Sansh Day won the Venice Silver Lion and was placed 9th on Kinema Jumpos Best Ten for the year. Chikamatsu Monogatari won numerous domestic prizes (including the Art Recognition award from the Ministry of Education) and was placed 5th by Kinema Jumpo. Uwasa no Onna won nothing and was placed nowhere. It is the least successful of Mizoguchis gendaigeki womens melodramas which focus on ladies entertaining/enduring men in houses of pleasure. The reason for this is hard to fathom for he was working with most of his favorite people  the actors Tanaka Kuniyo and Shind Eitar, the art director Mizutani Hiroshi, the cinematographer Miyagawa Kazuo, and his regular screenwriter Yoda Yoshikata. This should have been every bit as successful as the previous years Gion Bayashi, a film which it resembles a lot. Perhaps Mizoguchi was still smarting at the memory of Daiei interfering with both Ugetsu Monogatari and Gion Bayashi and was loathe to repeat the process, especially as the film initially came at him as a request from Daiei. Perhaps he was upset by the tension simmering between himself and Tanaka which would eventually lead him to prevent her directing a film set up by Naruse Mikio and Ozu Yasujir, an action which ensured Uwasa no Onna would be the final film of their 15 year/15 film collaboration. Rumours in the press had it that Tanaka had been the love of Mizoguchis life and that the sour grapes exhibited by him during the making of the film evidenced the fallout of her rejection of his romantic advances. People speculate on with no clear answers, but the fact is, Uwasa no Onna is a very well-acted, beautifully crafted melodrama which is certainly well-worth watching, but basic structural flaws (which ordinarily Mizoguchi would never have countenanced) prevent it from really taking off as both Sisters of the Gion (Gion no Shimai, 1936) and Gion Bayashi undoubtedly do. Where these two films provide razor-sharp x-ray views of a whole society in motion, Uwasa no Onna flounders on clunky over-obvious melodrama and unbelievable character motivation which is especially damaging towards the end. That said the film is well worth examining as it fits in so completely with Mizoguchis worldview.. . Like every characteristic Mizoguchi film, Uwasa no Onna centers on the key theme of women unfairly used and abused by patriarchy. Behind this pervasive theme lies a dichotomy between the Mizoguchi who attacks this social inequality with a series of narratives which indict men while eulogizing the strengths of women, and the Mizoguchi who endorses patriarchy by using and abusing women himself both professionally and in his private life. A voracious life-long devourer of geisha and prostitutes, Mizoguchi famously broke down when visiting the prostitutes ward of an saka hospital while preparing Women of the Night (1948). He told the patients, If you are here, its the fault of menIts MY fault too! Fueled also by other private circumstances (his beloved sister Suzu being sold off to virtual geishadom by his hated father, his education being funded by Suzus rich patron, his wife Chieko sinking into [some say] syphilis-induced insanity in 1941 while he worked on The Loyal 47 Ronin without ONCE taking a day off to take care of her), this dichotomy which stirred up so much guilty personal antagonism is most likely the creative well-spring for the incredible richness that feeds into the two kinds of film that he was synonymous with, the jidaigeki folk tale legend and the gendaigeki womens melodrama.. . The handling of women in both these forms is fundamentally different. As Dudley Andrew says in Mizoguchi a Guide to References and Resources (G. K. Hall, 1981), the jidaigeki are legends of women who suffer for an idea of culture that the film valorizes at the end. The inequality between men and women is part of a cosmic friction which just is  it is a metaphysical given which artists like Mizoguchi can show, but cannot change. The suffering of women is a necessary feature of social existence which humanizes/determines civilization as it has come down to us. The jidaigeki show history as having been made with womens suffering put into the context of this inevitable process. The gendaigeki on the other hand show history actually in the making where [Mizoguchis] heroines are in revolt against a system in which they are exploited, frequently without the aid of even the most fragile family support (Andrew). In the postwar democratic exposs (My Love Has Been Burning, Portrait of Madame Yuki, Oy-sama, The Lady From Musashino) women of isolated social position are brought tumbling done by the iniquities of patriarchy in a modernizing society, and in the films focusing on women without social position trapped in geisha houses, brothels or simply on the street (Women of the Night, Gion Bayashi, Uwasa no Onna, Akasen Chitai), they are forced first and foremost to rely on each other. What arises in these films is an instinct for salvation through generosity toward fellow women in revolt against the city of men (Andrew). This revolt is usually cast as a clash between two ways of dealing with patriarchy, the first through meek traditional submissiveness and the second through radical rebellion and an attempt to play men at their own game. Sisters of the Gion, Gion Bayashi and Uwasa no Onna all center on the relationship between two women, the older one embodying tradition and the younger one rebellion. All three narratives spin around the older wiser woman seeking to control and look after the younger one, and in all three the conclusion is the same, that whether a woman complies submissively or rebels, patriarchy crushes them anyway to the point that the only thing they have is each other. There is always pathos in the older womans position as she is resigned to accepting a fate which she knows cannot be avoided whilst delicately trying to make her younger charge aware of it.. . In Sisters of the Gion the two ladies in question are sisters working as geisha, the older one following the traditional path of giri (obligation), and the younger one following the modern path of ninj (personal inclination). Both paths are shown to be equally fruitless as both ladies are crushed. In Gion Bayashi the two ladies are a kind of mother-daughter team, the older one in effect adopting the daughter of her deceased best friend. Again giri and ninj are pitted together and again both are thwarted by patriarchy, the only difference being in the character of the younger one. In Sisters of the Gion Omocha (Yamada Isuzu) is a ruthless bitch who attempts to play men at their own game while in Gion Bayashi Eiko retains a degree of feminist fight, but diluted by innocence and naivety. In Uwasa no Onna the two ladies are mother-daughter, the traditional mother Hatsuko (Tanaka Kuniyo) seeking to control and guide her rebellious daughter Yukiko (Kuga Yoshiko). The difference between this film and the other two is a question of milieu. All three take place in Kyts Shimabara district, but while the other two are set in geisha houses, Uwasa no Onna takes place in a high class brothel. Hatsuko was a celebrated courtesan in her day and now she is the madam presiding over a number of younger courtesans in her establishment named Izutsuya. Mizoguchis final film Akasen Chitai (Street of Shame, 1956) takes place in a low class brothel so we can see a very conscious documentation on the directors part of the various grades of houses of pleasure with an emphasis on their decline from the sophistication of the geisha profession to the crude functionality of sex establishments. Another way to look at these films would be to see a circular pattern in the postwar films. Mizoguchi made Women of the Night (1948) which was essentially about prostitutes working on the street without the protection of houses and he moves from a geisha house (Gion Bayashi) to a high class brothel (Uwasa no Onna) to a low class brothel (Akasen Chitai) and then back out onto the street. Central to Akasen Chitai is an ongoing debate in parliament about abolishing prostitution and indeed this became fact soon after the film was released. Prostitution never dies of course, the legislation simply driving women out onto the streets in the situation we see in Women of the Night where they are subject to violent pimps, police brutality and lack of access to regular medical inspections. The point throughout all these films is that though Mizoguchi may appear to take a feminist stand against patriarchy with the geisha/prostitute in revolt against the city of men highlighted with the greatest empathy, patriarchy itself persists and remains pervasive as a central truth in the world he depicts. Indeed he remained a part of this patriarchy until the day he died.. . As in Gion Bayashi, patriarchy looms over both women in Uwasa no Onna from before the film begins. Hatsuko is proud to own her own establishment and to provide Yukiko with a decent college education. She runs her business well, treats her girls with respect and is outwardly content. However, her business isn't respectable and she longs to escape the stigma of being a brothel madam. She has been attempting to buy this respectability by marrying her young lover, Dr. Matoba (tani Tomoemon). She schemes to buy a house for him to use for his practise, expecting him to marry her in return. A doctors wife is the height of respectability for a woman in Japanese society even now, and she yearns for the position. Key here is that a womans respectability hinges not on her own personal graft, but on the position of her husband. Another man named Harada (Shind Eitar) would like to marry her (and is ostensibly a much better match), but working in the entertainment business himself his position isn't high enough to raise Hatsuko from her low station. To gain respectability women are is at the mercy of respectable men of social position. They cannot win respectability on their own. The stigma of her livelihood is made visual in the situation of her daughter Yukiko who returns from Tky at the films opening having attempted suicide there. We gradually learn that her fiance broke off their planned marriage when he learned that his future mother-in-law is a brothel-keeper. Yukikos whole future prospects are therefore blighted by her background even though Hatsuko has always attempted to separate her from it. The film is set out basically as a conflict between mother and daughter with Dr. Matoba as the catalyst for the inevitable explosion. The mother wants to follow the correct social path of marrying into respectibility while the daughter wants nothing to do with Itzutsuya and wants to escape back to Tky with the very man her mother wants to marry.. . The central emotional triangle is intriguing and the first half of the film successfully conveys the fractures that split these people as well as the emotional glue that binds them together. Courtesy of fine acting and delicate treatment of interior mise-en-scne Mizoguchi makes each of the these characters sympathetic and fully rounded though it is admittedly hard to like the typically weak vacillating Mizoguchian male in the middle who affects love for both women, but really only cares about himself. We admire Hatsuko for the way she runs her establishment, attempts to raise Yukiko and cares for her employees. Tanaka Kuniyo is perfectly cast being admirably equipped to play both the hard business-woman (treating her customers and scheming to get Matoba to commit to her) and the vulnerable woman who has been trapped in disrespect all her life and is finally so close to escaping it, and yet still so far. Kuga Yoshiko does well with a role which starts off neurotic and withdrawn, thaws out courtesy of Matoba and a closer interaction with the courtesans, and then finally grows protective of her mother. Its certainly not her fault that her characters actions become implausible at the end.. . The most successful scenes come in two trips to the Noh theater. The first has Matoba and Hatsuko sitting next to each watching a dance. He is entranced by the beauty of the ladies and avidly ogles them, checking his programme for their names. Hatsuko meanwhile scolds him and eventually rips the programme away from him inducing a peach of a sulking look. This is followed up by a kygen performance in which an old woman (obviously representing Hatsuko) makes herself ridiculous by chasing a young man with hilarious consequences. Matoba and Yukiko laugh aloud as Hatsuko feels humiliated. She draws the obvious conclusion  Young people should go with young people, and eventually magnanimously gives Matoba to Yukiko along with the money she has borrowed for the house he was supposed to buy for his practice. In this interaction of real life with theater (actually a standard Mizoguchi practice going back to saka Elegy [1936] which had an inserted Bunraku performance) the director gets effectively to the core of the drama in hand. We feel for Hatsuko here more than at any other point in the film precisely because Mizoguchi's engagement with his material is so tangible at this point.. . His engagement becomes altogether more detached in the second half. First there is the unconvincing way Yukiko is accepted by the courtesans of Izutsuya. At first they are separated from Yukiko and a few of them make disparaging remarks about her snobbery and her looks of contempt thrown their way. Then when one of their number (Usugumo) becomes sick Yukiko takes care of her and suddenly all the girls are won over into liking her. It is a cheap obviously scripted trick and feels entirely fake in the face of real human emotions and Yukiko's supposed hatred of the place and wish to leave. Then later after the doctor has dismissed himself and mother and daughter come together for mutual support (a sequence of convincing well-thought-out scenes) it seems Mizoguchi and Yoda didn't know how to finish their film and so resort to one of the oldest cod-melodramatic tricks in the book  the mother falling sick to bring the errant daughter to heel. This clunky melodrama would look out of place on stage let alone on film and to make matters worse, Yukiko is shown to change her character completely by taking over Izutsuya and becoming the new madam of the house. This makes nonsense of the main conflict of the film which has the traditional mother fighting patriarchy the accepted way and the radical daughter fighting patriarchy by renouncing it completely. Her final caving in is an extremely unlikely change in character motivation and leaves us unsatisfied as the film finishes. There is none of the poignancy of Gion Bayashi here, none of the double-edged tension which has women helping each other but still under the cosh of male power. Here it seems Yukiko conveys respectibility onto Izutsuya  her mothers battle to marry into respectability (as well as Yukikos own burning desire to escape) seem to have been no more than storms in the proverbial tea-cup. Fortunately Mizoguchi went on to make a much better film about women of the night which doesnt for one second compromise his hard view of women united in revolt against male dominion  the valedictory Akasen Chitai. That film seized his imagination in a way Uwasa no Onna obviously did not.. . CHIKAMATSU MONOGATARI (A Tale from Chikamatsu, aka The Crucified Lovers).

And I think that was the normal procedure to really catch the meaning of the novella and of Benjamin Brittens opera in its libretto and in its music the way Benjamin Britten meant it to be. I was seriously disappointed by the Glyndebourne production that made Tadzio a tease and thus insisted on an abstract and yet pathetically present and emphasized sensual and physical attraction of Gustav von Aschenbach for Tadzio, an attraction that was guided into something slightly perverse by the way Tadzio was playing the tease all along and particularly in the second act.. . Thats when I discovered this English National Opera production that is for me the perfect materialization on stage of what the deeper, more poignant and fascinating meaning of the opera in Thomas Manns as well as Benjamin Brittens intentions. They were in no way telling a slightly perverse pedophile story but something that reached the highest possible peak of understanding of what creativity is seen as the search of beauty and the sudden realization by an older writer (composer in Viscontis film which is slightly ambiguous as for this meaning) that he is going to die and finds in the vision of a nostalgic apparition, that of a mid-teens boy on a beach in Venice, that this nostalgia is the best psychopomp, in Greek mythology a guide of souls to the place of the dead, he can have to pass to the other side of this life that has come to an end with the desire mentally realized, hence a halliucination, or an illusion, that he is able to transfer his creative life energy to that 15 year old.. . But first the libretto.. . If you just read the libretto without considering the music, hence without listening to it, you have a very clear vision of this particular adaptation. It is in the text written if not composed in that libretto particularly faithful to Thomas Mann. So, the main character, Gustav von Aschenbach is the eye through which we see, seize and deem the situation, what is happening in Germany first and then in Venice. Aschenbach is thus telling us the story he is witnessing. It is always his point of view that is expressed and what happens around him is seen through his eyes. He remains on the side, on the shoulder of the road, distant and yet close, physically distant and unable to enter the situation  he is watching, and at the same time this situation is entirely captured through Gustav von Aschenbachs mind and consciousness via long introspective and speculative monologues. Gustav von Aschenbach hardly speaks to anyone apart from short questions, remarks or exclamations. No real discussion. No real exchange.. . The whole story is the story of a rite of passage from Germany to Venice, from the hotel to the city, from life to death, from ancient Greece to the modern world, from reality to the mind, from the real world to imagination. And in fact this imagination is haunted by what he has done and achieved in his life and what he is going to leave behind and to whom he is going to leave it, hence his heritage. And that means this go-between is going to be the psychopomp he needs to pass over to the other side.. . He is haunted by Ancient Greece. There are numerous direct references to Greek mythology: Apollo, Ganymede, Hyacinth, Dionysus, Zephyr, and so many others. He is a classicist and as such has devised a theory of beauty based on distance, hence the absence of feelings, sentiments, passions, and yet this cult of beauty is a passion, even for him since he states at the beginning: now passion itself has left me, though some may say at this moment Gustav von Aschenbach considers his creative power is stalled: hence his procedure of getting passions out might be creatively suicidal.  He would thus have devised a passion for beauty that has lost or has been deprived of its emotional and sentimental dimension, as he says only once and in passing though not flippantly, because his wife and his daughter are gone, meaning dead.. . The Greek line calls upon Eros first, then Apollo (also called Phoebus), Hyacinth, Zephyr, Ganymede, all having to do with the love of a God Zeus or Apollo for a young man Ganymede or Hyacinth killed by jealousy, from Hera or Zephyr, and turned into something eternal, the constellation Aquarius, or eternally regenerating by its own means, the flower hyacinth, by their respective gods that were loving them and were marginally their lovers since the Greek could not think of love without physical intercourse, even and maybe especially pedophile both gay (Socrates) and heterosexual (Venus and Adonis). The parallel with Gustav von Aschenbach is the attraction he feels for the young teenager Tadzio (at the most 15 since Thomas Mann describes him as not having hairs in the armpits) who he would like to endow with his own creativity to propel him into some celestial glory.. . This becomes clear when he evokes Socrates and Phaedrus when Socrates is going to drink the hemlock he has been sentenced to. It shows the older man, Gustav von Aschenbach just like Socrates, does not want any physical intercourse with the younger man, Tadzio just the same as Phaedrus, but some mental exchange, communion, transfer so that Phaedrus or Tadzio can continue Socrates or Gustav von Aschenbachs traditions, and Socrates sure did but via Plato and his Phaedo and other dialogue or Phaedrus the play, so not Phaedrus himself: here the simile comes from Thomas Mann who is the author through whom the fictional Gustav von Aschenbach survives, finds a second life beyond his death though not through Tadzio, with maybe a second tier in the simile in which Thomas Mann metaphorically identified to Gistave von Aschenbach survives or finds a second life beyond his death metaphorically evoked in Gustav von Aschenbachs death in Benjamin Britten evocation. Actually Gustav von Aschenbach is a writer in this adaptation like in the original and as such is writing in the story, and in a way reading for us what he is writing, which is a description of and comment on what he witnesses and desires. The music is going to set apart these passages of prose reading as opposed to the rest that is description or report of what is happening around the writer and not in his mind.. . Gustav von Aschenbachs dilemma is that his lifelong construction is coming to a point and a situation where and when it seems to be crumbling if not collapsing. His construction was a reduction of Eros to a mental shift from thought to reality along the following line: thought  feeling  mind  beauty  nature  ecstatic moment  genius  contemplation  reality, all coming true in the word, meaning the use of words, but also a direct reference to Gods creative word, since he himself is a literary creator. This comes to grips with Tadzio and his real name Gustav von Aschenbach assumes to be Thaddeus which is mysterious as for its meaning. We can think that /thad-/ is one root and /-deus/ is another. The second is a nominative Latin noun referring to god and the first one seems to be connected to various roots in various languages boiling down to the verb praise, which would make the name to mean praised by God, praised of God, God praising or God praised, always with the direct connection of God to the boy, God being the one who is praising, in this case the boy. You perfectly see the parallel with Ganymede and Hyacinth who were loved hence praised by their Gods Zeus and Apollo. You can see the parallel with Gustav von Aschenbach who as a writer controls the creative and divine word of literature and as such can praise the boy in the same way Apollo praised Hyacinth and Zeus Canymede.. . Gustav von Aschenbach is in the same way haunted by death, Socrates death, death lurking in Venice in the form of cholera, his own death he feels creeping up into him. He is dying, he will soon die, he actually dies on stage. If we might see some erotic dimension in the reference to Eros, we have to clearly understand that Gustav von Aschenbach blocked all occasions and all moments of desire he might actually have come to and never established any communication or contact with the boy or with his mother. At best some eyes that locked onto some other eyes and that is probably a phantasm in Gustav von Aschenbachs mind. He probably misunderstood the childs curiosity or vague interest or even concern for that old man on the beach writing in his book. The smile of a child that age does not mean anything erotic, just plainly surprise, interest, curiosity or whatever along that line deeply connected with some pleasurable transference. When Gustav von Aschenbach finally comes to the conclusion that he loves him at the end of the first act, it is not what some would like to understand:. . Ah! Dont smile like that!. No one should be smiled at like that.. (realizing the truth at last). I  love you.. . That truth is love not desire for any physical intercourse. At least not the one some may think of who cannot see love is not hormonal but first of all mental, and at that level the attraction is for what is identical, similar to you, with whom you can share an existential vista in life and achieve some similar goal: here the similar goal is beauty, as identified by Gustav von Aschenbach: the ideal mental beauty Gustav von Aschenbach has created and devised in his writing career and the beauty this boy embodies in real flesh, but a beauty that remains a mental set of proportions and forms. At the beginning of the second act he will come back to this phrase and will discard it:. . . . . the hackneyed words I love you. . . This I love you must be accepted; ridiculous and sacred too and no, not dishonorable, even in these circumstances.. . Note here the three qualifiers ridiculous, sacred . . . and no, not dishonorable . . . come after the third repetition of I love you with a big pause between the first and the second. This ternary figure is fundamental in this libretto where it represents some level of perfection but here that perfection is warped if not distorted by the contradictory ridiculous and sacred amplified by the negative, triple negative in fact, no, not dishonorable, as well as by the aforementioned pause that is reproduced in a sort of mirror image by the double negation no, not that works like the pause between the two acts.. . Ridiculous for an old man to love a boy of course: what does he expect from that improbable meeting? But sacred too since the old writer loves his ideal of beauty realized in the proportions and forms of this boy, hence some divine connection between an ideal and a reality. And it is in no way dishonorable since it has nothing to do with voluptuous pleasures that would be pedophile and thus despicable. And then he goes to the barbers shop for the first time where he is not going to have himself made up for the boy, like an old teasing boy-tempting predator, but in fact he is going through some symbolical embalming. He is preparing himself not for the meeting with the boy that will never happen but for the meeting with death that is bound to come, that is coming, that is already here. And it is interesting that the barber, one identity of the multiple character devised by Benjamin Britten, more about him later, pronounces the word sickness for the first time, which confirms Gustav von Aschenbach in his anxiety about it that caused his false or failed departure. We can in fact think that what Gustav von Aschenbach calls his renewed creativity at the end of the first act in which he finds the proper words to describe his feeling up to the point of I --- love you that derails his inspiration, is in fact the result of the disease that he is going to develop in the second act.. . His renewed inspiration derails after a short while. This renewed inspiration is caused by the vision of Tadzio that his developing sickness derails into something he will then reject because of its sensual nature he cannot accept. His sickness, creeping death in Venice and swelling death in him make him betray his own creative ideal. This is marvelously shown in the present DVD where there is absolutely no flesh shown, or molded by close-fitting clothing or bathing suits or trunks: where there is no teasing whatsoever on Tadzios side who is a lively, fit and even athletic though not muscular mid-teen who is having very athletic and acrobatic activities with other mid-teen boys his age; where there is a very systematic and progressive evolution in Gustav von Aschenbachs behavior revealing the progress of the disease right to death itself on the stage. The disease, and death, makes him nostalgic about youth, his youth, and makes him desire to have that vision of Tadzio, that boy himself as the psychopomp he needs to die, to cross the Styx, this time really and not in a gondola driven by the gondolier, Charon himself, who is part of the multiple character, the way he said when arriving for the first time to the hotel.. . And yet he comes to a very selfish and self-centered position when he finally knows some epidemic is going around in Venice and he expresses his resolution about the Polish family, hence Tadzio:. . They must receive no hint.. They must not be told.. They must not leave.. . And thats the fundamental point. The boy has to stay because he has a part to play in the old mans death and that part is clear at the end, the very end. He is the psychopomp of Gustav von Aschenbach. He is the one who takes him from the world of the living to the world of the dead. He is the one who is making him cross the Styx to deliver him in Hades, he is Dantes guide to hell, Virgil. He is the one who can best bring Gustav von Aschenbachs life to its end and introduce him to his posterity. He is the best relay to that posterity. And yet it is vain in Gustav von Aschenbachs mind because he has transmitted nothing to the boy, he has not even spoken one word to him. But he thinks; the boy is more or less following his intentions, sentiments, postures, etc., as if there were some mental extra-sensorial communication. But that is an illusion and we can consider it as pure nostalgia of an old man for the time when he was a boy the age of Tadzio.. . This adaptation is a long song and cult to death seen as a closure and as a loss, but we have to wonder if the bigger loss is on the side of the dying or on the side of the living. The tale here tries to imply the loss is on both sides though it can only be mental, abstract, and yet the younger survivor is taking along into his own life the feeling and maybe emotion he felt when he locked his eyes onto Gustav von Aschenbachs eyes and smiled. He will forever remember that moment of flippant emotion, even if he never knows what it is really.. . When you have read the libretto like that, you can then wonder what Britten is going to do with it and the music he is going to add to every single word, particularly when one actor is going to be constantly present along with Gustav von Aschenbach because he is The traveler who announces at the beginning there is going to be a passage from here to there; the Elderly Fog who is passing from Trieste to Venice on the boat and who is passing with a band of young boys, rather in the twink bracket, going to Venice to meet the girls; the Old Gondolier who will pass him from the harbor to the Lido against his will and disappear before he could pay for the ride; the Hotel Manager who is passing him from the entrance to his room and from his room to the beach through the suites window he opens, and from the hotel to the outside world on departure day; the Leader of the Players who is passing everyone from their rich surrounding to his sorry and squalid songs from the bleak world outside, and pulls his tongue at them at the end; the Hotel Barber who will embalm him in the second act into a fake renewed person or perambulating body at the most, passing him from the old living person he was, maybe still is, to a younger looking vain already dead perambulating corpse; and finally Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Semele, the lover and mother who was killed by Hera, Zeus wife, and yet Zeus managed to save the young embryo of Dionysus by embedding him in his thigh to incubate till birth them parted.. . This Dionysus appears to Gustav von Aschenbach in his dream as the opponent and contender of Apollo. Against Apollos trinity of beauty, reason, form that founds Gustav von Aschenbachs belief in non-erotic and de-carnalized beauty based on mental reason and abstract form, Dionysus defends a more sensitive, emotional, passionate, sense-based life:. . Receive the stranger god. . .. Do not turn away from life. . . . Do not refuse the mysteries. . . . He who denies the god, denies his nature. . . . Come! Beat on the drums. . . . Stumble in the reeling dance. . . . Goad the beasts with garlanded staves,. Seize their horns,. Ride into the throng.. Behold the sacrifice. . . . Taste it, taste the sacrifice.. Join the worshippers;. Embrace, laugh, cry;. To honor the god.. I am he!. . This Dionysus in Gustav von Aschenbachs dream defeats Apollo who walks away and yet the dreamer when he wakes up is not able to enter the dance of love, of pleasure, of bliss, of physical enjoyment. He will remain with Apollo and his de-carnalized conception of love as beauty and not orgasm. Gustav von Aschenbach did not have a wet dream of any sort in his sleep in spite of Dionysus. In fact he never got his feet wet because he never went to the sea and he only crossed water pieces of any size with a ship, a gondola or a bridge, never feet first in the water.. . We can regret Gustav von Aschenbachs impotence or frigidity but he is not in anyway trying to seduce the boy, which would make him a pedophile; not trying to make the boy seduce him since he never encouraged any contact by being unable to establish even the beginning of such contact.. . He is a writer who is conscious at the end of his life that he leaves behind no one and maybe nothing that could perpetuate his creativity. Thomas Mann like Benjamin Britten left this world with no one to continue their work. At best their works have been collected and are still published or performed but in no way continued though we could say many writers and composers owes something, maybe  a lot, to Thomas Mann or Benjamin Britten. So after all it is for Mann and Britten some sad nostalgia for youth at the time when they are passing to the other side with the help of a psychopomp vision of a young teenager who looks beautiful to them in their old age.. . The music is in itself a marvelous experience. I do not want to give all the original points it contains. It is entirely conceived and designed to set up the meaning of the opera. Every single moment, every single character and at times every single emotion or feeling, reflection or thought of Aschenbachs are supported, emphasized and magnified by the music. I will only give some examples.. . The fact that there is no overture transforms the first scene into the most meaningful element of the opera. It is the archetype of the whole architecture with the two main singers of the opera, one character, Gustav von Aschenbach, here impersonated by John Graham-Hall, and the singer Andrew Shore impersonating seven characters. In fact all along it is going to be a duel, a fencing confrontation between the two singers and the seven characters of the second singer are of course one mega-character: the archetypical psychopomp who will deliver Gustav von Aschenbach to death when the eighth impersonation of this mega-character who does not sing nor speak in the opera, viz. Tadzio, gives the signal of death Gustav von Aschenbach needs to finally pass over.. . This English National Opera adaptation makes the signal a lot less obvious, if there is a signal of any form. Gustav von Aschenbach on the beach tries to get up but collapses into the sand when Tadzio is left for dead on the beach, face in the sand. Then he crawls when Tadzio who had been severely beaten by a teenage friend of his moves after the third call Tadziu from the chorus (there will be a fourth one from the chorus and the final word of Gustav von Aschenbach is Tadzio, fifth instance of this pentacle, and is it the pentagram some see in Dionysus?). Gustav von Aschenbach will manage to crawl back to his deckchair and climb into it and collapse, breathing heavily while Tadzio is walking away into the sea to the blaring and blinding sun and does not seem to look back. Gustav von Aschenbach will finally die in his deckchair and Tadzio will go on walking to the sun that turns brown slowly and then fades out to black. There it is clearly different from the libretto (if the video does not betray the scene) that says Tadzio gives the signal of death. In fact this way of showing it emphasizes the fact that Tadzio has finally grown out of his childish smile (just the same way as he did not laugh during the comedians act at the hotel one or two nights before), out of his childish vanity and even curiosity and is finally able to leave the dead man behind and walk to his own future life. And Gustav von Aschenbach climbing back in his deckchair to die seems to accept this fact since Tadzios job is finished, well done since Gustav von Aschenbach is dying and is finally dead. Charon can disappear: he is no longer needed.. . This introductory scene gives to the overture at the beginning of the second scene, the passage to Venice on the ship the most dramatic value with the mega-character tempting, teasing Gustav von Aschenbach into his destiny which is to die, and he even predicts how he will die, when he will die, when his pretty little darling decides. In fact this meta-character is Dionysus himself who is only supposed to be a voice in the opera. Dionysus calls for real life, real love, real passion, that is to say physically and hormonally fulfilled love, passion, life, in the form of a dance to celebrate the sacrifice offered to the God of mysteries, and this sacrifice is always human, though it is no longer performed as such by any priest, except in the symbolical Eucharist, but is a self-sacrifice in which a mortal offers himself to this God of mysteries when time has come to die. Death is no longer a plague, the way it is described in Venice, but it is a self-offering to the God of mysteries. We are here at the root of death as liberation.. . But to enjoy that passing over you need a psychopomp and that is the meta-character, that is Tadzio, the meta-characters silent impersonation. When we reach the last wordless scene, or nearly wordless, a vague chorus in the far distance calling the name of Tadzio four times, and a final exhaling breath on Gustav von Aschenbachs side in the shape of Tadzios name and, so say the stage directions, at a clear beckon from Tadzio, Gustav von Aschenbach slumps in his chair. And the psychopomp is not needed any more, thus Tadzio continues his walk far out to sea. You can see the difference with this production.. . Every intervention of this psychopomp Dionysus, in any impersonation he takes, is marked by the music in an original way.. . When Gustav von Aschenbach reflects on life, arts, death, love or whatever other mental subject he sings a cappella with only some piano notes now and then to punctuate his thinking. When he goes to the beach the music becomes luminous and Tadzio is introduced by what I think is a metallophone or xylophone: clear, metallic notes in light succession. Very beautiful and happy, sky deep but with no mystery, no secret, just attraction and appeal, but the appeal of beauty, though as Gustav von Aschenbach says this beauty. . . Discovered through the senses And senses lead to passion . . . And passion to the abyss. And this abyss is Dionysus message: . . . taste the sacrifice. Join the worshippers, embrace, laugh, cry, to honour the god. Note the trinity of embrace, laugh, cry. There are many other instances of such trinities of words like the second and last instance of eating strawberries that are declared soft, musty, over-ripe, which makes them the symbolic hemlock Gustav von Aschenbach who thinks he is Sicrates at that moment shortly before his final demise, will die of. And Gustav von Aschenbach turns Dionysus sacrifice around in his mind and it becomes O the taste of knowledge. And remember Apollos trinity of beauty, reason, form that echoed Gustav von Aschenbachs simplicity, beauty, form. And Gustav von Aschenbachs so be it of the first scene in which he accepts to go south as the psychopomp traveler tells him to do, will be echoed by the so be it, so be it on his return to the hotel, to Tadzio, after his failed moving out. It will then continue into the Ite, missa est of the priest in Saint Marks, accompanied by tolling bells (and that is not the only time: we had those tolling bells in the overture to Venice. And this resignation will become his acceptation of Dionysus decision about his sacrifice: Let the gods do what they will with me. And just an instant later: Do what you will with me. One repeated twice make three, amplified once, make four and amplified again two more times makes six, the number of Solomon, of perfect wisdom, of the completion of a cycle, of a life well fulfilled.. . That strong sense of resignation is entirely contained in the last remark of the Hotel manager: We must all lose What we think to enjoy the most. And the music shifts to flutes and the beach and Tadzio and Tadzios fight with Jaschiu and his message it is time to move out since he Tadzio is no longer a boy because he has been defeated and nearly choked to death, his face held down in the sand: he has become a man and as such cannot be adulated as pure beauty by Gustav von Aschenbach any more. The light aerial surreal and outlandish music of the end carries the two out and brings us to a concluding vision of our own passage to the other side of the Styx river, ferried over by Charon in his boat. There is there in this production a perfect unifying feeling that we, the audience, are transported to both the future and death by this teenager who has just come of age in life to some sunny future.. . We could take every scene and show how the music transcends the simple situations and gives them a new dimension, a new greatness, at times when it is satirical grandiosity, even grandiloquent greatness. And I must this production, with John Graham-Hall and the other singers, is clear and luminous. We can follow the words that are being sung because the articulation is careful and targets understanding, which is often rare on the opera stage. Opera English has a tendency to become a foreign Himalayan language when sung by some opera singers or even opera companies. Some conductors probably require that kind of articulation that mashes up the language. And that may happen even with this opera. For example the Glyndebourne production does not even have today standard English subtitles for those who have some hearing problem, thus amplifying the difficult slightly mashed up pronunciation. And this production corresponds as for this clarity to the original recording with Peter Pears under the guidance of Benjamin Britten himself.. . To conclude I think it would be a good thing for anyone who wants to penetrate this opera to start with this production faithful to Benjamin Britten before moving to others and particularly those, if you can find them on DVD, that visualize the flesh and body of Tadzio who can appear in one of them only wearing a string bathing suit.. .

Winsor could afford to bask in the fervor her book had inspired. Over 100,000 copies sold within the first week; the eventual tally of 3 million, by the time Keane and the Catholic Church had had their say, doing little to stop its runaway success. In fact, it probably helped.  Nothing appeals quite so much to the general public as sin  particularly viewed from the strictures of button-down conservatism run amuck.. . Indeed, not even the widespread condemnation of the novel as pornography in fourteen U.S. states could prevent it from becoming a best seller.  Winsors fifth draft caught the eye of publishers, though they elected to distill her prose to one-third their original size, the novel still sporting a formidable girth of 972 pages.  Still, contained within them were references  or, at least inferences  attesting to seventy acts of intercourse, thirty-nine illegitimate pregnancies, seven abortions and ten rather blatant descriptions of women undressing in front of menshocking! In her own defense, Winsor was to reply some years later, I wrote only two sexy passages and my publishers took both of them out. They put in ellipses instead. In those days, you know, you could solve everything with an ellipsis.. . By todays laissez faire standards, allegations of smut are laughable. Forever Amber is nothing if a well-written and expertly concocted pulp about a womans desire supplanted  and ultimately destroyed by her own folly. Implied or not, Forever Amber comes from a particular ilk in historical romantic fiction perhaps having reached its zenith with Margaret Mitchells Gone With The Wind. In the wake of Mitchells zeitgeist and, of course, Selznicks immortalized and celebrated movie version, other studios began to scramble for like-minded fare; tales of headstrong female protagonists defying the social conventions of their time  and occasionally, also the wisdom of their male superiors  to bring about scandal and reformation; though ultimately wreck and ruin upon their own heads. Such was the tortured suffering of the fictionalized female martyr; ringing truer still to the American woman circa 1942 and beyond. As the menfolk went off to fight in another war, the home front became a bastion for the pursuit of meaningful work outside of the home. Hence, the independent woman rising above squalid circumstances by her wit and stubbornness alone proved an elixir of the times.. . Alas, Forever Amber presented Darryl F. Zanuck with a considerable quandary. For the novels Amber St. Clair was something of a truly unrepentant harpy; deliciously vial in spots and maliciously inclined to stir mens hearts to her own advantage, whatever the sacrifices made along the way. In some ways, Amber and Scarlett OHara are kissing cousins; although it is unlikely either could have been friends: too much similarity and competition. Translating the book to the screen also presented deeper concerns. How to tell the tale of an enterprising creature who effectively wenches her way into Charles IIs court, gives birth out of wedlock, murders a nurse and is responsible for the death of at least two men  one, her lover, the other her husband. Surely, Hollywood censors would objectand did! To be sure, Winsors novel counterbalances such overt debaucheries with selfless acts of human sacrifice; Ambers devotion to Bruce Carlton; the heroic officer who cannot recognize her qualities beyond a brief nights interlude, resulting in a child; her never waning devotion to him (nursing Bruce back from the plague) despite her frequent dalliances with courtiers and the King.. . Zanuck was forced by the Production Code to omit virtually all of the novels more salacious moments. As a result, Otto Premingers Forever Amber (1947) became something of a sissified wan ghost flower of its source material, the emasculation utterly complete by the casting of fresh-faced Linda Darnell as the fiery and uncompromising vixen; herein more prone to sulking and skulking about the antechambers and bedrooms of some well-heeled suitors.  Screenwriters Philip Dunne and Ring Lardner Jr. did their utmost to suggest the tawdry appeal of the novel; their efforts submarined by Zanucks inability to spend as lavishly as he would have preferred. Hitherto, the novels reputation as a provocative page-turner had also begun to cool. Although Zanucks publicity department gave the movie a big build-up, Forever Amber was something of a modest success to meager disappointment for the studio.. . Removed from all of its timely hype, Forever Amber  the movie  is a fairly enjoyable romp, never entirely prone to bouts of tedium, though occasionally veering dangerously close to becoming a wordy critique on classicist social mores, vices and virtues. Moodily lit and photographed by cinematographer, Leon Shamroy, exquisitely scored by David Raksin, and, given over to the visual aplomb of production designer, Lyle Wheeler and costumer, Ren Hubert, Forever Amber emerged as something of a lush and lovely, eye-popping spectacle; Foxs trademarked use of Technicolor at its most gaudy and glistening, yields to a ravishing milieu that tragically and singularly fails to enthrall.. . Perhaps audiences of the day expected better  or at least  more of the novels combustible and scintillating ardor. The movie equally suffers from the miscasting of Linda Darnell and Cornel Wilde; two undeniably handsome people who fail to generate the elusive spark of on-screen chemistry to make their passionate love affair click. It doesnt help the screenplay keeps its lovers apart for the bulk of the films138 minute run time. While Darnell is in virtually every scene, Wilde floats in and out of the story  each time with a little more abject contempt and self-righteous piety for our sexually adventurous heroine.. . On paper, Forever Amber is a fairly ambitious and compelling tale of a womans self-destruction, made wholly and unnecessarily complete her ill-fated lifes decisions. On film, however, the plight of Amber St. Clair becomes little more than rank melodrama, gussied up by A-list production values. The Dunne/Lardner screenplay does an impressive job of distilling the novels timeline into a manageable would-be epic. At 138 minutes, Forever Amber falls short of the road show spectacle Zanuck had originally envisioned, in part, because the movies rough cut was eviscerated in the editing process at the behest of the Production Code: whole scenes excised and/or reshot to receive its approval. Zanucks clashes with the code are legendary. In hindsight, his reoccurring battles on Forever Amber, having to veer so far away from the novel in order to make any movie based upon it, were a primary reason Zanuck would later cite for leaving Fox at its zenith to make pictures independently abroad. If Forever Amber lacks narrative impetus or character motivation, it is arguably the fault of Zanucks inability to win his battles with censorship rather than Zanucks fervent desire and meticulous pre-planning to transform the novel into a screen spectacle on par with Gone With The Wind.. . Sadly, Forever Amber is no Gone With The Wind, despite its all-star cast and the immeasurable gifts bestowed upon its production by those toiling being the scenes. Whats there is always expertly crafted, if leadenly realized by Linda Darnell and Cornel Wilde. Curiously, Darnell seems reticent to portray the sultry Amber in all her ruthless objectives. Darnell was hardly a stranger to playing the vixen as she had already amply proven with Chihuahua in John Fords My Darling Clementine (1946) and would illustrate again, as Lora May Hollingsway two years after Amber for Joe Mankewicz in A Letter to Three Wives (1949). As Amber Darnell is stiff and uninspired: pitiably nervous at times too and simpering to a fault. Amber ought to have been a fiery wench who could either gingerly cut her teeth on any mans heart or trample it into the ground. Darnells viper is little more than a wounded lamb in wolfs clothing; lost, confused and totally out of her depth.. . Cornel Wildes career has always fascinated me. Here is a man who rarely rises above his material, and frequently pandered to the crowd by unabashedly displaying the obviousness of his own physical prowess as compensation. Even in his own time, hunks were considered a dime a dozen; rarely given the opportunity to progress beyond B-grade matinee idol. By comparison, Wildes career is downright enviable, playing everything from a flamboyant trapeze artist (The Greatest Show on Earth 1952) to Frdric Chopin (A Song to Remember 1945). Along the way, he appeared opposite an enviable roster of A-list leading ladies and worked for some of Hollywoods biggest directors. To what fairy godmother does the actor owe his career? Hmmm. In Forever Amber, Wilde seems moderately hampered by his effete wig; given shoulder pads that would make Dynastys Joan Collins envious. Hes competent - though just barely and mostly forgettable and flat. Forever Amber would have immensely benefited from the presence of a Clark Gable or William Holden. But Wilde was under contract to Zanuck, so we get his particular brand of mediocrity instead.. . Mediocre is a good way of describing Fox Home Videos efforts on their MOD DVD program in totem. I have avoided reviewing their burn-on-demand product thus far because, frankly, some of the discs Ive seen coming down that pipeline have turned my stomach; Cinemascope movies presented in non-anamorphic or pan and scan transfers, elements culled from old VHS or 16mm archives slapped out to disc without so much as a generic clean-up; non-progressive and badly faded video (rather than film) based elements, et al. Yuck and who needs it?!? So, it was with some trepidation I undertook to screen Forever Amber; oddly, the first transfer I am prepared to write about without making myself physically ill.. . As we all know by now, Fox junked its original Technicolor separation masters for virtually all their product pre-1970, leaving badly contrasted and garishly undernourished Eastman transfers as the only resource from which to do further remasterings of classic titles. It is important to remember also that, though this is a travesty akin to painting a black moustache across the Mona Lisa, weve also borne witness to what the studio can do when time and money are correctly spent to resurrect and properly update tired old transfers in 1080p; Niagara (1953) being a prime (though not the only) example.. . Alas, Forever Amber is not a Blu-ray. Nor is it a legitimately authored DVD, but rather a burn-on-demand disc that, at times, Id consider nothing better than a Frisbee. Remarkably, most of the image is free of age-related artifacts. Not so remarkable is the clumpy, chalky color. In no way does Forever Amber even minutely hint to replicating vintage Technicolor. On occasion, the color genuinely pops with surprising sparkle. I was amazed by the scenes at court, where color suddenly became exceptionally vibrant. Alas, a fair amount of Forever Amber takes place at night and these sequences suffer from lower than average contrast. There are moments where only disembodied heads are discernable, floating in a sea of blackness. There are also some misalignment problems with the Technicolor, resulting in very annoying halos. Certain scenes are very softly focused. Badly done.. . As expected, fine detail is wanting, though not uniformly.  Finally, the Fox logo appearing at the beginning of Forever Amber is not indigenous to the period  but rather from a vintage owing to the late 70s and significantly grainier than the rest of the image that follows. Regarding film grain  its virtually non-existent. True, Technicolor was a sort of grain concealing process. But this just looks scrubbed  either digitally or, presumably, from being derived from an older video master made when VHS was king and things like film grain were a non-issue.  Finally, theres modest gate weave factored in and some sprocket damage that causes certain scenes to wobble.. . Forever Ambers original mono audio has been faithfully reproduced with minimal hiss and virtually no pop  impressive on the whole. Alas, Fox hasn't given us ANY extras. I could forgive this  almost  if Fox had taken the time to encode the disc properly so its time stamp wouldnt periodically appear. Alas, no chapter stops either, though one can advance at ten minute intervals throughout this disc. Bottom line: Im going to do some heavy praying the people in charge of Foxs MOD program get their act together - and soon - instead of continuing to release substandard product like this to home video and just hope the rest of us haven't figured it out just yet. To Fox executives responsible for this travesty: you're winning no points simply by making such drivel available in lieu of quality.

In August of 1996, the San Jose Mercury News broke the big one. That some elements in and around the Contras were mixed up in the drug trade wasn't exactly news: the Kerry Committee had exposed this to some degree back in the 80's. But the SJMN's series written by Gary Webb went much further. It stated that a drug network consisting of people involved with the Contras (i.e. Oscar Danilo Blandon and Norwin Meneses) were selling to LA crack kingpin Freeway Rick Ross and that this network opened the first pipeline between Colombia's cocaine cartels and the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Furthermore, it also stated that the cocaine that flooded in helped spark a crack explosion in urban America. The role the CIA played in this was left somewhat ambiguous by the series. While not explicitly saying the CIA made a calculated attempt to encourage this, it did make innuendos about it by doing such things as constantly referring to the Contras as the CIA's army and the logo of the series was a man smoking crack superimposed on the official seal of the CIA.. . The controversy that followed was one of the biggest in modern journalism. It led to papers and other outlets attacking the SJMN, and ultimately the SJMN backtracked on the story. Webb and the paper soon parted ways. Webb wrote the book 'Dark Alliance' some years later but became a pariah in journalism and never worked for a major paper again. Depressed over his inability to find work, Webb committed suicide in 2004.. . Now Webb is back. Played (superbly) by Jeremy Renner he is brought back to life in this film based not only on Webb's book (i.e. 'Dark Alliance') but also Nick Schou's book 'Kill The Messenger'. From everything I've read on the man, this film captured his passion and drive for what he did, but also how that passion created difficulties for him. You also get a sense of Webb the family man (i.e. how he worked to have a good relationship with his children and also the struggles in his marriage).. . But another aspect of this film are some issues with accuracy. Indeed, considering the beating the series took over accuracy....you would have thought the film would have kept the facts squeaky clean. But unfortunately: it doesn't.. . As it begins, Webb's tip that broke open the story led him to court to observe Blandon's testimony. In the film, Blandon testified that the CIA came to him and Meneses and asked them to raise money for the Contras (knowing that they dealt drugs). In actuality, Blandon said Meneses or Enrique Bermudez [in the grand jury transcript called \"Enrique Ramunez\"], it's not clear which one (Blandon's english wasn't clear at times), is who asked him. In either case, neither person amounts to representing the CIA: Meneses definitely was not, and Bermudez wasn't. And even if they were: Blandon himself later specifically denied that Bermudez asked him to raise money through drug smuggling. Meneses said the same thing. The SJMN quoted Bermudez (via Blandon) as saying the \"ends justify the means\". But Blandon himself said he didn't take that as meaning they should traffic in drugs.. . Also, Blandon's actual testimony could easily be interpreted as he had stopped sending money to the Contras before he was selling to Ross. (Ergo, the notion of sales to Ross being funneled to the Contras was bogus.) And Ross was mixed up in selling drugs before he ever met Blandon.. . The film also doesn't really develop the history of the drug (which really undermines Webb's contention). The Medellin cartel had already established contacts in LA and was importing the stuff well before Ross was in business. For example, in 1979 (before the Nicaraguan revolution happened), federal agents busted up a Colombian ring in Granada Hills that had been flying in 200-kilo cocaine loads via Lear jets and Cessnas. (Cartels like the Medellin and Cali organizations revolutionized the drug trade by switching to mass moving the merchandise (as opposed to the old \"mule\" methods).) Kingpins in south central LA like \"Tootie\" Reese had established links with the South American cartels well before then. 3 Federal investigations into this established that. (Most notably the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation.) On the east coast, they had established a base of operations on Norman's Cay in 1978 that created a cocaine pipeline to the whole east coast (and beyond).. . And this isn't just taking the government's word for it either. Checking several newspaper archives, I found that cocaine was all over LA county (including south central) by the late 70's. One article (entitled 'Cocaine use up for white collar workers', by the NY Times News Service and carried in several newspapers (on 9/16/1979)) stated that (according to Raymond Wells, a LA county criminologist): You can find cocaine anywhere in L.A. County, from the lower to the upper classes. Other articles found echo the same thing across the country as cocaine was about to surpass coffee as Colombia's number one export. This resulted in a glut on the cocaine market that drove prices down and made it more available. The crack aspect of it came into play as word spread as how to make it. This didn't have anything to do with the people in Dark Alliance (despite its claim that Blandon was the Johnny Appleseed of crack in California). Webb himself said he found formulas for cooking up crack going back to the 70's, and Ross specifically denied anyone associated with the Dark Alliance story ever taught him how to make crack.. . As far as the manpower involved goes, in 'Dark Alliance' Webb lamented about the lack of public outrage that the CIA had worked cheek by jowl with more than 50 suspected drug traffickers. First off, they obviously were not on the payroll to run drugs (despite what some may think). They were on the payroll to keep the Contras in supply. And secondly, to put that number in perspective, according to 'The War on Drugs: An International Encyclopedia': \"an estimated 300 Colombian trafficking groups and 20,000 Colombians were involved in the cocaine trade in the United States [by the late 80's]. At least 5,000 of the Colombians who worked for the cartels lived in the Miami area and another 6,000 in the Los Angeles area.\" In other words: the cartels had about as much manpower in the United States alone than were in the entire Contra movement. (The Medellin cartel employed 750,000 people in Medellin.) So needless to say, the cocaine trade wasn't hinging on 50 guys associated with the Contras.. . Furthermore, the Dark Alliance series by its own numbers undermines the notion of Ross & Co. starting or maintaining such a epidemic: Webb gives the number (in 'Dark Alliance') Blandon sold to Ross at around 5 tons. By DEA estimates, more cocaine went to Los Angeles in a *single* year (i.e. 1980; before Blandon was selling to Ross) than Ross sold over 8-10 years.. . It's also important to put into perspective who Ross's suppliers were: they were not Contras who went into dealing to support them.....they were dealers sympathetic to their cause who kept most of the money they made. That's an important distinction.. . How much Blandon and Meneses gave to the Contras is a frequent point of contention with the story. Although Webb claimed millions, most provable estimates are between 50 to 100 thousand dollars. But simple logic can solve the problem, or at least undermine the notion we are talking millions. Up until 1984, the United States put up about 70 million for the Contras. In 1985, the war ground to a halt because Congress cut off funding (in-part triggering the Iran-Contra affair). Congress re-started funding in 1986 and ergo the war started back shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, during this period, Blandon and Ross had (literally) piles of money laying around (we are talking in the hundreds of millions). So where was this coke money when the Contras needed it? Furthermore, why even bother with the Contra aspect of Iran-Contra (which got them maybe 2 million from the diversions of the arms sales to Iran) when all that coke money was supposedly out there?. . A big part of the film was the supposed CIA media campaign against Webb. (Via most of the major national newspapers. Before the movie came out, an internal document from the CIA appeared discussing how they supposedly influenced things through productive relations with journalists.) The depiction of this treatment was somewhat accurate: they did (at times) put words in his mouth. But to say the only sources for the media's scrutiny was CIA officials just isn't true. In particular, the LA Times was singled out in this regard. In the film, Webb calls a guy named Rich Kline to complain about the Times [CIA] sources for their attacks. (Since the LA Times had no one by that name on the story, I assume it was supposed to be Jesse Katz.) But in the oft-criticized LA Times story (in part because Katz had made grandiose statements about Ross before Webb's story broke), aside from law enforcement officials and former gang members, Ronald K. Siegel (a UCLA professor who was one of the first to do research on smoking cocaine) was one of the sources. Also quoted was Malcolm Klein and Cheryl Maxson, USC sociologists (Klein is considered an expert on gangs). And its obvious they did their research as the drug dealers they name are all easily verifiable. At Webb's own paper, Pete Carey (who co-wrote the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake story with Webb; a series of stories that won the staff of SJMN a Pulitzer Prize) called 30 cocaine experts and not one of them agreed with the notion \"that Ross played a critical role in either crack cocaine's origins or its eventual spread throughout the country\" (to quote a line directly from 'Kill The Messenger' (p. 155) that didn't make it into the movie).. . The movie also depicts (some would say fabricates is a more accurate term) a number instances of personal harassment [and contact] of Webb by the government and its agencies. Before he even writes the story, some \"agents\"/\"a few guys from D.C.\" meet with him and try to warn him off and also make a implied threat against his family. Ray Liota plays a CIA agent who sneaks into Webb's hotel room in the middle of the night to tell him he is right. And finally, Webb fires a warning shot at a guy hanging around his car at night. Following that, some unidentified people start going through Webb's files while he is talking to the police. To my knowledge, even Webb didn't claim any of these events happened. I think the closest thing to this was the fact Webb once shot a would-be car thief who came at him. But this was in Kentucky and years before he came across the Dark Alliance story.. . As the controversy develops in the film, a montage is shown of a variety of leaders in the African-American community reacting to the story. Among those shown is one Maxine Waters, a Congressional Representative of south central LA. A well known demagog on anything relating to race, she infamously described former LA mayor Richard Riordan as a plantation owner and sat in the basement of a church during the 1992 LA riots and blamed everyone *but* the rioters for what was going on up stairs. (The latter made for one unforgettable moment of the TV show Nightline.) While Webb distanced himself from some of the accusations of people like Waters (who was anxious to find a scapegoat for the situation in her district), he failed to distance himself from them personally, which is something not addressed by the movie. (Waters wound up writing the foreword of 'Dark Alliance'.) At times, this gave the appearance of him backing some of the more outlandish charges associated with the story.. . But if there was any doubt where Webb stood on the government's involvement.....it was pretty much settled once 'Dark Alliance' was published in 1998 (the timeline of the movie ends before this part of Webb's life). Not only that, it severely damaged whatever credibility Webb had left by trying to pass off some stories as genuine that are ludicrous on their face. One notable one had to be the Allen Raul Rudd story. According to Rudd (a captured Colombian trafficker), then VP George Bush flew down to Colombia to strike a deal with the Medellin cartel: they could fly as much cocaine into the USA as they wanted as long as they sold guns to the Contras. The deal was sealed with cartel leader Jorge Ochoa and Bush posing for a photo together with suitcases filled with cash. Even some of the people sympathetic to Webb (like David Corn) admitted they had a hard time keeping a straight face reading that one. To believe it, you would have to accept that Bush/Reagan carried out this agreement by shutting down the aforementioned  Norman's Cay (which was put out of business due to pressure from the US government in 1982) not to mention all the other pressure the US government was putting on them as time progressed. (Which resulted in some members of the cartel putting a bounty on members of the DEA). You'd also have to believe that no one in the Medellin cartel would bother to produce this photo as President Bush was pressuring Colombia into a war against them that would end in many of their leaders being either killed or thrown in the slammer.. . Such stories demonstrate one of the inherent weaknesses of Webb's work: Too much was riding on the word of drug dealers facing some serious charges. Drug informants, indeed just about all criminal informants, are notoriously unreliable.  According to Northwestern University Law School's Center on Wrongful Convictions (in 2004), 45.9 percent of documented wrongful capital convictions have been tied to false informant testimony (the leading cause). And drug dealers have dreamed up whoppers of this magnitude before. Probably most famously (or some would same infamously): the case of Christian David. David claimed that he knew of a Corsican hit team that were the actual assassins of President Kennedy. A producer believed him and it became the basis for the television series 'The Men Who Killed Kennedy'. (It's also important to note that David's story got some degree of corroboration from Michel Nicoli. Nicoli was a former heroin trafficker who had testified for the US government in drug trials before, and was considered by the government to be very reliable.) Later it turned out that all three assassins were overseas the day David claimed they were in Dallas. (Whoops.). . At the end of the film a number of statements appear that are somewhat misleading. For one, it mentions the the Director of the CIA's appearance in a town hall type meeting with the citizens of south central Los Angeles, and that the director left the CIA a month later. That leaves the impression Deutch left the CIA because of the Dark Alliance series. Deutch was actually forced out because the Clinton administration was upset with his testimony to Congress on Iraq. A statement is also made that the CIA released a report that acknowledged the fact  they ...associated with members of the Contra movement who engaged in drug trafficking. True. But just not the ones Webb wrote about. The mentioned report specifically denies that the agency ever had any contact with Ross, Blandon, or Meneses. Furthermore, that report (and the unmentioned DOJ report), far from being a vindication for the Dark Alliance series, blew a great many holes in the story. And finally, Webb's two shot suicide is mentioned. The movie states it was ruled a suicide. But there is little doubt. Webb had made arrangements for his cremation (as well as other things), and even his own family does not doubt it was a suicide based on his actions before hand. (Nick Schou covers this in 'Kill The Messenger'. In a way, it was kind of good this aspect of Webb's life was omitted from the film because it made for some depressing reading.). . So at the end of the day, where does this leave us? On the one hand, I liked Webb's moxie in being willing to go after something like this and challenge the establishment. It's also an important reminder of the type of people we get mixed up with in clandestine operations. (Which was a continuing theme in the Cold War.) It also forced the CIA to come clean about the fact it was looking the other way with regards to some of these people's backgrounds.. . On the other hand, the overreaching (and sometimes ridiculous) claims of the series and book have put some myths into the nation's blood stream that abides to this very day. In fairness to Webb, if the series had better editorial oversight, it probably could have been saved. But apparently there was some struggle between editors (unrelated to the series) that let this slip through the cracks. However, I think Webb should have known better than to print some of the things that went into 'Dark Alliance'. (Not to mention getting involved with some people that had ties to the Christic Institute's lawsuit. For more on that, see Glenn Garvin's review of 'Dark Alliance' available on Reason.com's web site.) Also, the movie (while not a documentary) was disappointing in its handling of the facts.. .

Ive seen the set offered for less than $15 at times. That averages out to not much more than a quarter per movie! So even if you find movies in the set you don't like (which Im sure will happen) its hard to feel ripped off at those prices - assuming you can find some movies you do like, that is.. . This is quantity over quality, though. At roughly $0.25 per movie you get what you pay for. There is no restoration of audio or video and no extras of any kind. So if you're anal about quality then you might as well not even bother with this set. But then whos to say that if you spend $15 on some of these movies by themselves you're really getting enough quality improvement to be worth $14.75? There are at least a few titles herein that have no better buying option available. I sometimes use cheap sets like this as a sort of sampler, finding those rare movie gems then finding higher quality editions.. . These huge collections tend to be public domain movies (many of which can be obtained legally for free with some time and diligence). In some cases such as the 50 Horror Classics pack they tend to be public domain because of their age but are often very good movies.  In the case of Chilling Classics they tend to be public domain more because they weren't worth the effort of keeping up with the rights.. . Don't get me wrong, there are some movies in this set worth seeing. I found some I would consider to be gems. However, while some are good none are 5* level, and many stink like a convenience store bathroom.. . What kind of movies will you get? Some of these are monster movies, some thrillers, some more along the lines of drama with sci-fi or horror tropes, some mob movies that wouldn't fit into the horror or thriller genres at all. One is actually a documentary rather than a movie. Some are old black-and-white while others are more contemporary. Several are dubbed foreign movies which, as best as I can tell (since they don't actually specify), represent Spanish, French, and Japanese cinema.. . Something to watch out for is the movie list. There are different editions of the collection with slightly different movies included. The one Ive seen the most comments on is Deadtime Stories. This is missing from the more recent editions of the set (word is that they realized this wasn't a public domain movie and had to pull it from the set as a result). Ive seen a Christmas movie listed in past editions (dont remember the exact title) thats not in my set, and have heard of other discrepancies. (UPDATE: Ive recently confirmed that the new editions of the set do have some changes from the one I have - most notably Peter Jacksons Bad Taste as well as a couple of other titles have been replaced.) So I guess my best advice is to either buy the set in a store where you can examine the exact movie list you're getting before making the purchase, or don't get your heart set on owning any one particular title because theres a chance you might not get it.. . The questionable content here ranges quite a bit with some movies rated G and some most definitely R. There is plenty of sex, nudity, rape, incest, violence, gore, strong language, drug use, etc. Some moves are appropriate for younger audiences, but the set as a whole is not at all kid friendly.. . Ive had my set a while so the packaging has changed I do believe. Mine is a big box with a velcro flap which holds the discs in their individual cardboard sleeves. Its comprised of 12 double-sided discs. Most have 2 movies per side though some have more. The cardboard sleeves have movie summaries and a few basic details. This has most likely been updated to a plastic box with paper sleeves.. . Mill Creek used to put their logo watermarks on their movies. I hope whoever thought this was a good idea got fired because its annoying. Fortunately, I only noticed it one or two times in this set (though unfortunately one of the best titles is one of the ones so marked) so it won't affect my rating.. . MOVIE LIST:. Here are the movies in my edition of the set with some brief comments. Ill try to get around to posting full reviews of each movie sometime soon. (UPDATE: In case you missed the earlier notes, the current movie list is different from mine with at least 3 or 4 changes including Bad Taste. Since the list will probably change again and Im not familiar with any of the new titles I won't try to keep my list updated. Just keep your eyes out for those differences if you get interested in any particular title.). . -The Alpha Incident: Some people at a remote train station are infected by an alien virus.  They have to stay awake or die while scientists hunt for a cure.  Mostly drama with sci-fi tinges, it's decent but not great.. . -Bad Taste: Peter Jackson's first production, a low budget, homemade flick.  Aliens are wanting to turn humans into the next intergalactic fast food craze, and a makeshift commando group is resisting them. It's mostly just a mindless gore fest with plenty of sick comedy.. . -A Bell from Hell: A young man has been released from a mental institution and plots revenge on his aunt and cousins for putting him there. A thriller that goes in unexpected directions this one has promise and good moments but doesn't deliver as a whole.. . -The Blancheville Monster: A girl's family has been told that a curse plaguing them will lift if she dies before her next birthday. Either the monster roaming the grounds or an inexplicable illness will surely get the job done but not if her friends have anything to say about it. It's a decent movie of suspense and mystery.. . -The Bloody Brood: A drug dealer peddling to beatniks gets a power trip by watching people die. When he orchestrates a murder the brother of the victim comes looking for the culprit. It's not a bad offering though it is beatnik overload. Peter Falk stars.. . -A Bucket of Blood: Dick Miller plays a nobody who wants desperately to fit in with the cool beatnik crowd. He begins turning living beings into sculptures. His work is a hit, but of course no one realizes the secret to his success. How far will he go to stay on top? It's a pretty good dark comedy if you can overlook some logistical problems.. . -Cathys Curse: A little girl is possessed by the spirit of her dead aunt. She begins lashing out at others and driving Cathy's mother insane. It's a bore of a movie.. . -The Cold: A group of bored rich folks invite a number of people to take part in a game of fear that will leave the winner rich. But is the game lethal for the losers? Not worth watching, the plot unravels and is unsatisfying.. . -Crypt of the Living Dead: A grieving son unwittingly releases a 700 year old vampire from her prison tomb. As she wreaks havoc on a small island village the man responsible for her release must find a way to stop her and the cult that would serve her to save the woman he loves. Its a pretty enjoyable but poor quality vampire flick.. . -Death Rage: A retired hitman comes back to the job when information about his brothers murderer comes to light. This is an unimpressive mob movie. Its Yul Brynners last starring role.. . -Deep Red: When a psychic is murdered her neighbor catches a glimpse of it and sets out to catch the killer. Aided and hindered by a pretty reporter the pianist/would-be gumshoe searches for clues in his scattered memory. It's not an awful movie, but it is forgettable probably due to several cuts made to the original film.. . -The Demon: This one follows two intertwined stories that don't feel properly connected. One is about a kidnap victim whose parents call in a psychic to help. His revelations only result in tragedy. The other is about two cousins one of whom is dating a rich playboy and one of whom is being stalked. It's a dull and unimpressive flick.. . -The Demons of Ludlow: The spirit of a man mistreated by the town he founded resides in a piano presented to the townsfolk as a gift generations after the founder's death. The spirit begins taking lethal revenge on the descendants of the people that wronged him. Not worth watching.. . -Devil Times 5: 5 criminally insane children are unleashed upon an isolated cabin full of people to be used for murderous amusement. It's a disturbingly creepy and fairly well done film - one of my favorites in this set.. . -The Devils Hand: A seemingly happy man turns from his normal life to the pleasures of a dark cult. Can he realize what he has given up or will the cult be the death of him? It's an interesting and dark tale of carnal pleasures vs. good sense.. . -Dr. Tarrs Torture Dungeon: Based on Edgar Allan Poes work this one is about a reporter who is writing a story about the peculiar treatments used at a sanatorium which he visits. He soon learns that the place has been overtaken by the inmates. Trapped, he and a few others must find a way to escape the walls built to keep lunatics inside. While interesting at times I wasn't very impressed. There are better adaptations of this story on film.. . -The Driller Killer: A struggling artists flips his lid and goes on a killing spree with a power drill. It's a string of pointless scenes intermingled with lots of shots of a performing band that isn't much good.. . -Drive-In Massacre: A sword-wielding maniac is slicing people up as they watch movies in a drive-in theater. Two cops investigate the crimes questioning ex-carnies, bullying bosses, and peeping toms. Is it anger, lunacy, or perversion that is leading the killer to do his bloody deeds? Is any movie patron safe? It tries some interesting tactics but isn't all that good a movie.. . -Funeral Home: A one-time funeral home is now being turned into a bed and breakfast by the wife of the mortician who mysteriously vanished into thin air some years before. It seems that disappearances are disturbingly common around this area. The granddaughter of the owner home comes to town to help the new establishment get off the ground, but when more people begin disappearing she can't help but be curious about what's going on. That's going to get her into a world of trouble. This is one of the best movies in the set. I enjoyed it a lot.. . -The Ghost: The wife of a wealthy, crippled man and her young doctor lover plot to kill the older man, but when he's out of the way his wealth isn't where it's supposed to be. The secret lovers begin scouring the estate for the missing jewels, but strange things are happening. The ghost of the murdered man wants vengeance. This one is borderline decent; mostly my complaint is that it just takes too long to get to the ghostly part of the story.. . -Gothic: This is the tale of the real-life night Mary Shelley came up with the idea for Frankenstein. It is a fictional tale despite using characters based on real people. It's a disjointed romp through a dark house during a storm with little rhyme or reason. Julian Sands and Natasha Richardson star.. . -Hands of a Stranger: A pianist loses his hands in an accident and is given those of a dead mystery man. He starts losing his mind leaving people dead in his wake. It's right on the verge of being enjoyable with a weak premise holding it back.. . -Haunts: A killer terrorizes a small town, and a lonely farm girl is particularly traumatized. The trauma doesn't end with the cessation of the killings, either; there's more going on here. A fairly decent movie  nothing great but not a complete waste of time.. . -Horror Express: An archaeologist has found what he thinks is the missing evolutionary link between humans and primates. As he's transporting it on a train, this fossil comes to life and start killing people. Some think it's the devil, others think there's something more natural going on here. The two professionals join forces with an investigator and other train passengers to try to figure out what's going on and stop the killing. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing star with a small role for Telly Sevalas. Despite the strong actors the movie is not very good.. . -Horrors of Spider Island: A plane carrying a group of dancers on the way to a show crashes on a remote island. The manager of the group is bitten by a weird spider and begins mutating into a monster. As the girls are tormented by the murderous man-beast they think they have found rescue in a group of mining researchers, but they might not last long enough to get away. This is a really, really bad movie.. . -The House of the Dead: A man lost in the city is brought in by a kindly mortician who shows him 4 coffins and tells him 4 stories about the occupants: a stalked teacher, a videotaping serial killer, a couple of feuding detectives, and a tortured man. Some of the stories here are good, but others not so much. Some of the performances are surprisingly good.. . -I Bury The Living: The director of a cemetery learns that if he places a marker on the map the owner of that plot dies. As people try to convince him it's nonsense they lead him to kill more and more people. Wracked with guilt and questioning his sanity the poor man tries to figure out what he should do even to the point of calling the cops on himself. Yet he can't seem to simply stop putting the markers on the map. It may sound goofy, but it's actually a pretty decent movie.. . -I Eat Your Skin: A playboy writer is sent to a remote island full of voodoo rituals. Bad luck and zombie maniacs create danger for the writer and his friends as he tries to save a pretty girl living there from a cult that wants her for a sacrifice. She is refusing to leave because of her father so the writer must stick around to play hero. This is an unimpressive effort on all fronts.. . -Jesse James Meets Frankensteins Daughter: Gunslinger Jesse James takes his injured friend to a doctor for help. This doctor is part of the Frankenstein family and is hiding out in the old west to continue their legacy of questionable experiments on humans. It becomes gunslinger vs. mad scientist and her monsters. While very campy I enjoyed it a lot.. . -Lady Frankenstein: When Frankenstein succeeds in creating a monster which kills him, his daughter takes up the mantle. According to her she wants to create a monster that can stop the killer (mostly to save face for her father's reputation), but her motives and methods are questionable. I didn't like anything about this movie. It's a weak story poorly executed.. . -The Legend of Bigfoot: This is a supposed documentary about a wilderness tracker who becomes convinced of the existence of Bigfoot and tracks the beast across the continent finally capturing footage of the creature in the wild.  It's perhaps mildly interesting if you're into Bigfoot legends or wildlife footage (low quality as it may be).. . -Man in the Attic: In the midst of Jack the Ripper attacks in London a strange man takes up residence in a room and board place, only he prefers the attic to his room. Some are suspicious of him while others think he's being unfairly judged just because he's a bit odd. It's an OK flick but with a lack of closure for most of the characters. Jack Palance is the man in the attic.. . -Medusa: A brother and sister used to a life of wealth and ease find out they are in danger of losing their inheritance. They set out to save their lifestyle by any means necessary including murder. But who is the victim and who is the culprit? It's a poorly paced nothing of a movie. Don't bother. It's mostly just an hour and a half of George Hamilton on screen.. . -Memorial Valley Massacre: People are being murdered in a newly opened camp ground. The park ranger refuses to close the area due to secret, dark personal ties to the place. It's a mostly mindless slasher flick with an unusual culprit.. . -Messiah of Evil: This one revolves around a young woman who travels to a rinky dink town to find her father who cut off communications mysteriously. She is walking into a nightmare as she reads about her fathers descent into madness, a madness that seems to have affected the whole area diving them to cannibalistic tendencies. Her only companions are a trio of strangers who have been shunned by the townsfolk. It's a strange but artistic film with good and poor aspects. Check it out if you enjoy HP Lovecraft.. . -Metamorphosis: This story centers around a geneticist who thinks he is on the verge of cracking the secret of aging in the body. When squeezed for results he tries the experiment on himself before it's actually ready. The results lead the scientist to carry out violent deeds without memory of them. As his body continues to change he must find a cure before it's too late, but his fellow scientists are blocking his lab access. It has some OK moments of suspense but is mostly unimpressive especially the shocking end.. . -Naked Massacre: A man with a serious hangup over women holds a group of young nurses hostage as he abuses and kills them. It's a disturbing movie made more so because of connections to a real-life story.. . -Oasis of the Zombies: Zombie Nazis guard a lost treasure in a remote desert oasis. When a group of treasure hunters sets out to find it they are set after by the undead guardians. It manages to be entertaining just by being extremely campy but is not worth the effort for anyone looking for a serious movie.. . -Panic: A lab accident turns a scientist into a murderous monster. A detective and a lab assistant set out to stop him. It's mind-numbingly dull.. . -The Revenge of Dr. X: A NASA scientist on vacation creates a plant man that likes to kill people. It's really, really bad.. . -Scream Bloody Murder: Matthew has a hangup about men touching women which leads him to kill even his own father. When he reaches his teen years he befriends a prostitute whom he torments. It's mildly interesting.. . -Silent Night Bloody Night: A string of murders one Christmas are somehow tied to an empty house and its past secrets. Is the new owner a crazed psychopath or a victim like everyone else? It has some interesting ideas but doesn't deliver at all.. . -Sisters of Death: Members of a sorority are lured to a reunion helmed by the father of a girl who died in an initiation of theirs. Is he out for lethal revenge? The living try to figure out what's going on as they one by one drop dead. It's a mildly entertaining flick with a satisfying ending.. . -Slashed Dreams: Jenny and her new boyfriend go on a wilderness hike to find a hermit friend of theirs. They are tormented by a gang of hillbillies. There's very little suspense and too many musical montages. A young Robert Englund has a small role.. . -The Snake People: Spanish soldiers and an innocent girl cross paths with a voodoo society. One of Boris Karloff's final films and not his shining moment.. . -Track of the Moon Beast: A man mutates into a lizard monster and kills people.  Can his friends find a cure for him before he kills the woman he loves? It's not terrible but is mostly unimpressive.. . -Virus: A doomsday virus has all but wiped out human life on the planet. Only an Antarctic outpost and a few isolated groups survive. Continued survival is the next challenge especially when automated defense systems set in place by the  world's governments threaten to finish the job of annihilation. It's a fair effort with several fairly big-name actors, but it suffers from being too broad in scope and slow-paced.. . -War of the Robots: A scientist and a girl are kidnapped off a space station by aliens. The fate of the installation and the alien race hang in the balance.  Not worth watching.. . -Werewolf in a Girls Dormitory: A werewolf is killing people at a girls' school. Some think the new teacher with the shady past is using the monster story to cover up his own misdeeds, but he claims to be trying to cure the wolf disease. It's not very good.. . -The Witchs Mountain: A photographer and his spur-of-the-moment love interest take a trip to the mountains where they are lured to an ancient village apparently inhabited by witches. It has some creepy moments which give it potential but the plot is too convoluted to be interesting.", "timestamp": 1496016000, "rating": 4.0, "sentiment": 0.0536638634053555, "overall": 6.634159658513389, "wordCount": 1248, "customer": {"customerId": "A1P8MONAX2LKQJ", "name": "Chad the Sith Lord", "cluster": 2}, "product": {"asin": "6303690653", "title": "Milpitas Monster VHS", "brand": "Paul Frees", "imageUrl": null, "price": -1.0, "categories": ["Genre for Featured Categories", "Horror"], "avgRating": 3.261744966442953, "avgSentiment": 0.1047782106001937, "avgOverall": 6.023690492943437, "reviewCount": 149}}, {"summary": "History fused with mythology to magical effect", "review": "Theo Angelopoulos' penultimate work is the first part of a hugely ambitious attempt to encapsulate on film the history of Greece in the 20th century. Initially he wanted to make just the one feature, but it mushroomed into a trilogy. This is actually his fourth trilogy, but only the first where the word `Trilogia' appears officially in the title. The Weeping Meadow deals with Greece from 1919 through to 1949. Part two, The Dust of Time deals with the diaspora experience of Greek immigrants, following them across the world in the time frame 1949-2000. The final film, The Other Sea, was set to deal with Greece's economic crisis at the beginning of the 21st century, but sadly Angelopoulos was killed in a traffic accident leaving the project incomplete.. . The Weeping Meadow marks the director's return to the political and historical complexity of his Trilogy of History (Days of '36, The Travelling Players, Alexander the Great) and The Hunters which he made in the 1970s. There he deploys Brechtian allegory making for a rigorous and deeply profound discussion of 20th century Greek history. Angelopoulos' focus in all his films has always been on how the country has been tragically crippled by cycles of violence - wars, socio-economic (and therefore political) unrest, foreign occupations, reoccurring Fascism and the destruction of Greek rural communities with heavy immigration to America and then later to Russia and Germany. Angelopoulos sees all these things as factors which have all but killed off Greece as a major power today with few prospects for a better future. Many describe his films as pessimistic though the director himself prefers the word `melancholic' and this is a film which could be read as a summation of his `melancholic' world view.. . As in The Travelling Players, Angelopoulos builds his film out of 3 thematic layers. Instead of history, myth and theatre, we have history, myth and straight melodrama. The story centers on the return of two immigrants from Russia in 1919, named Eleni (Alexandra Aidini) and Alexis (Nikos Pousanidis). Alexis is the son of Spyros (Vassilis Kolovos) and Danae (Thalia Argirioua) while Eleni is a Greek orphan whom the family picked up in the Odessa streets as they fled the advancing Bolshevik red army. The group of returning immigrants is granted an area of land near Thessalonika by the Greek government where they build a village, calling it `Little Odessa'. As they grow up, Alexis impregnates his adopted sister and the parents are obliged to hide the birth of twins who are given up for adoption. Following the death of his wife Spyros arranges to marry Eleni himself. But the reluctant bride and Alexis run away, taking refuge with Nikos (Giorgos Armenis) and his band of travelling musicians in an abandoned theater. Time passes. Alexis' skill on the accordion ensures he can work with the musicians and he enjoys the only freedom he will ever have with Eleni. Spyros however constantly tracks them and in a key scene after dancing with his `wife' he has a heart attack. Eleni and Alexis return the dead body to their home village for the funeral where they are greeted with the ridicule of the villagers who accuse them of in effect killing their father. A violent storm floods the village and Alexis and Eleni have no choice but to take their children back to Thessalonika. Alexis takes up an offer from a famous band leader and he sets sail for America promising to send for Eleni and the children when he can. The rest of the film focuses on Eleni's spells of imprisonment (because she harbored Nikos, a communist), and her final release in 1949 where she has to identify the bodies of her two children who lie dead on the battlefield of the civil war. Alexis also having died in the Pacific War, Eleni is left alone with nobody. She screams to the heavens.. . On the levels of history and mythology, the film succeeds triumphantly in presenting a picture of the country which concurs completely with the Angelopoulos world view. I will come to the problematic melodrama later, but first, the history. As always with this director names are important. We should start with the character of Eleni. Her name comes from the root Greek word for `Greece' which basically means her story is the story of Greece. Her partner is named Alexis, a name coming from `Alexander', another name which is strongly connected with the country. Remember Angelopoulos made a complex political allegory on Greece called Alexander the Great wherein a peasant bandit merges into a combination of the great emperor from antiquity and the `father of modern Greece' Theodoros Kolokotronis, a fighter in the War of Independence (1821-29). At base then the depiction of Eleni and Alexis represents a depiction of Greece and key historical events that happen are refracted significantly in their story.. . The first key event is depicted in the film's opening sequence which has a large group of immigrants returning to their original homeland from Russia as exiles from the civil war then gripping the country. The immigrants arrive out of the sea and walk towards a river, their shadows eventually reflected in the water as a narrator tells us this is to be the story of Eleni (of Greece). Angelopoulos makes very careful use of water throughout the film representing as it does the tide of political uncertainty that envelops everyone and everything. Initially the village of Little Odessa is dry, suggesting hope for these people, but rain clouds gather gradually as the Fascist movement gains force throughout the depression years. Things come to a head when Angelopoulos presents the country's descent into Fascism as a dance followed by a flood. During an impromptu social gathering arranged by the travelling musicians the ousting of a fascist infiltrator interrupts the celebration of the Greek people. Then Spyros enters and dies, the meaning being that old Greece has been betrayed by the young (Alexis says `I killed him'), leaving the door wide open for the Fascists to take control. The funeral cortege by boat to the village commemorates the death of a free Greece. That night's storm and the consequent flood is a metaphor for the August 4th military coup that seized Greece with Metaxas coming to power. From 1936 through to 1949 Greece was engulfed by the uncertain tides of war and successive Fascist regimes (Metaxas, Mussolini, Hitler and then the Fascist Royalists in the civil war) and the water that engulfs the film from this point on reflects the way the expression of free Greek people was drowned and the consequent terminal decline of the country.. . Following Alexis's departure to America along with thousands of other Greeks at this time (in itself a major historical event), Eleni's (and Greece's) imprisonment is related very well in her mad ramblings which tell us of the succession of imprisonments she (and her country) has had to endure, where she has been denied water, writing paper to communicate with her children and her own dignity. Foreign occupation whether it be Italian, German, American or British is all the same - it still equals the enslavement of Greece to the agendas of bigger powers intent on cold war politicking and it is the Greek people who suffer. The return to the battlefield scene is rendered with an extraordinary crane shot, starting with the train bringing the women to the riverside. The women are told their sons and husbands are lying behind them and in a moving scene they have to identify the corpses. The camera continues moving along the riverside and zooms in resting on Eleni at the bottom of the frame, her dead son lying by the river at the top and a torrent of water flowing between them. Even in death Greece and her sons are divided by the tide of the powers that be.. . The Greek civil war is related by having Eleni's twins fighting on opposite sides and a simple scene where they meet in a ceasefire of the battle on a ridge. They console each other because of the death of their `mother'. Their mother is still alive meaning the `mother' they are talking about is Greece which between them they are in the process of slaughtering. The film's final scene has Eleni return to the flooded village to claim her second slain son, the flooded village being another obvious symbol for the country which lies in ruins. The Royalists will win the war and 1952 will usher in the Papagos administration which will take a hard line on communists, leading eventually to yet another period of Fascism following the Colonels' Coup (1967-1974). No wonder Angelopoulos finishes his film with a long slow zoom in on Eleni (Greece) as she crawls towards her son and screams to the gods as the camera zooms above her head into the sea which has engulfed the country in tragedy. The pessimism at Greece never finding a solution to her many internal problems is a theme that this director obsesses over from first film to last.. . Underpinning the history is a rich bed of myth which Angelopoulos deploys to deepen his film and universalize his message. The Travelling Players closely follows the great myth of the House of Atreus as described by Aeschylus in The Oresteia, allowing the events of the plays to drive the action of the film. The Weeping Meadow however, plunges into mythology without letting any single myth shape the narrative quite so specifically - perhaps a more accurate reflection of the way Greek mythology has affected the cultural history of the country. Most prominent is the use of the Oedipus myth especially as written down by Aeschylus in Seven Against Thebes, the third play in a cycle which presumably covered the same ground as the extant Sophocles cycle. The myth shows how an original crime (a man killing his father and marrying his mother) gives way to an incestuous lineage which dooms the city of Thebes to destruction. Alexis and Eleni are cast in the roles of Oedipus and Jocasta while Spyros (also the name of Angelopoulos' father by the way) assumes the mantle of Laius. Alexis and Eleni's crime is incest (they are both brother/sister and son/mother even though not blood-related) which leads to the death of Spyros. Over his father's dead body Alexis assumes responsibility for the patricide. Meanwhile the land (Greece/Thebes) goes to waste (flood) due to the curse brought down by the gods for the crime. The villagers (acting as a Greek chorus) perform a ritual dance to expunge the evil spirits. Accordingly, the `evil spirits' return to Thessalonika with their twin boys. Later the twin boys assume opposing sides and meet each other in the civil war meaning they represent Polynices and Eteocles, the twin sons of Oedipus who fight over Thebes and kill each other in Seven Against Thebes. Other myths saturate the film. Names give obvious hints. Alexis' mother is named `Danae' who happens to be the mother of Perseus (Zeus being the father), the slayer of the Medusa. Her sister is named Cassandra which obviously comes from the Trojan War myth and in the film she voices the prophecy that the country will be doomed by the actions of Spyros' children at the film's outset. Then there is the myth of Odysseus and his endless voyage home most clearly laid out in the farewell scene when Alexis leaves for America on a ship, his Penelope (Eleni) giving him a piece of wool-wear which he unravels as his boat takes him away. For Angelopoulos the whole diaspora experience of Greeks following the tragedy of the civil war could be seen as a re-enactment of the age old myth of voyage and the eternal hope for a great return. This will assume center stage in The Dust of Time.. . There is no doubting the staggering richness of what Angelopoulos offers here. The entwining of myth and history makes for spellbinding cinema. Sad to relate though I find the film's total success is qualified by its failure to integrate the melodrama of the central love story within the impressive historical/mythological framework. The film that most comes to mind while watching The Weeping Meadow is The Travelling Players and one can't help drawing comparisons almost totally to the disadvantage of the later film. The Travelling Players was a highly successful left-wing history of Greece from 1939-52 told on three levels of allegorical interpretation - history, theater and myth - which dialectically relate to each other throughout. Angelopoulos deploys a complex time scheme wherein we are constantly alienated and come away with the sensation of watching past, present and future all at the same time - Greece's inability to escape from her tragic past being precisely the point. The Weeping Meadow covers much of the same ground, but rejects complexity for the sake of a straight narrative which starts in 1919 and finishes in 1949 with no deviations in between. This puts heavy stress on the mechanics of conventional plot construction and psychological motivation of the characters. These two things have never been Angelopoulos' biggest strengths and he avoids them in most of his other films. Here there is stiff melodrama, some awkward dialog and even narrative ellipses which simply come over as bad story-telling, dislocated as they are from the Brechtian rigors of The Travelling Players wherein ellipsis of both time and place seems masterly by comparison. Because the story takes place in linear fashion, we constantly expect the central relationship between Eleni and Alexis to develop satisfactorily. In fact it doesn't. The actors can't be blamed for the script denies us any kind of entry into their plight as we have a series of astonishing set-piece scenes which clearly set out an altogether different agenda. Angelopoulos seems to think it is enough to show his victims kissing here and there and then show them worrying over their atrocious surroundings with frowns of consternation and grand declamatory gestures. This might work on stage, but film requires more intimacy. Angelopoulos as per usual refuses to let us close to the characters, keeping his camera back ensuring grand panorama wins over human drama. It's clear that as with The Travelling Players, the director is more concerned with focusing on history and myth and that his characters are simply ciphers - they exist to represent something other than themselves. This means we can never believe in these characters as real people and that on the level of personal drama the film fails. In The Travelling Players this didn't matter as Brechtian alienation rendered characters artificial in any case, but here it is clearly necessary that we believe in the central couple. Lack of belief clearly compromises the success of the final tragic scenes.. . Perhaps The Travelling Players succeeds partly because The Oresteia provides a firm frame for the dramatic action that takes place. Myth is inseparable from the drama of history and Angelopoulos doesn't need to build his own narrative in that film. In The Weeping Meadow music takes the place of theater. Wandering actors become wandering musicians and it is much more difficult to tell a story through them. Both groups represent the conscience of the Greek people, but where one is easily rendered on screen by the plays they enact, the other remains elusive. In one way, this provides Angelopoulos with scope to use a very beautiful Eleni Karaindrou musical score and to construct a series of extraordinary music-inspired sequences which give the film a distinctly `folky' texture, but on the other hand it leaves him with an empty hole in the narrative which he has to fill with melodrama of his own making. The stiffness of this becomes even more apparent in The Dust of Time.. . Problems of melodrama aside though, this film is still a hugely ambitious and extraordinarily imaginative recreation of the past which only Angelopoulos could have made. His world view and the means he uses to express it remain peculiarly his own. Andreas Sinanos' camerawork here is especially noteworthy entailing wondrous long takes which are dripping in melancholic beauty - the field of sheets hung up to dry, the long slow zoom establishment shot of Little Odessa (the village that Angelopoulos had constructed from scratch) in which we are shown a world, the beautifully worked-out dance scene, the farewell of Alexis as he boards the ship for America (the ship made to look bleached out like one of the old photos used in the opening credits sequence), and most impressively of all those marvelous aquatic sequences of the funeral cortege going back to the village and then the evacuation after the storm. For long sequences of the film the fusion of history and myth with extraordinary cinematography makes for an over-powering effect. I can't think of anything else that compares with Angelopoulos' vision at such times. That in itself makes for a film worthy of the strongest recommendation.. . This Artificial Eye DVD is excellent, the pictures (aspect ratio 16:9) and sound very sharp. The film comes with an Angelopoulos filmography and a good 30 minute interview which gives some insights about the film and on working with Tonino Guerra, Marcello Mastroianni, Eleni Karaindrou and others. I recommend you buy this as part of Volume 3 of the complete Angelopoulos collection rather than individually. The disc is exactly the same and you get Ulysses' Gaze, Eternity and a Day and The Dust of Time as well. All four are remarkable films, the first two being especially successful in my view. I have already posted reviews of all three box sets on Amazon. Angelopoulos is a wonderful director and deserves the strongest possible recommendation. If you are interested in contemporary art cinema at all then you should definitely try him.", "timestamp": 1411430400, "rating": 4.0, "sentiment": 0.0689288395538395, "overall": 6.6723220988846, "wordCount": 1031, "customer": {"customerId": "APN2A9RHVXGTT", "name": "Film Buff", "cluster": 1}, "product": {"asin": "B0008JII3O", "title": "Trilogy: The Weeping Meadow", "brand": "Alexandra Aidini", "imageUrl": null, "price": 30.97, "categories": ["Movies"], "avgRating": 4.75, "avgSentiment": 0.0360094826157326, "avgOverall": 7.340023706539332, "reviewCount": 4}}, {"summary": "Nobody has Worse \"Bad Days\" than Jack Bauer", "review": "Season two has just as much excitement and suspense as season one. Terrorists want to blow up a nuke in LA. The president turns to Jack Bauer to solve the problem. The president is helped by his own integrity but faces real problems of backbiting within his administration. CTU has the same problem. The president is great. I wish we really had leaders like this.. . Episode Synopses appear below:. . 8 AM - 9 AM - Jack Bauer has left the CTU after the death of his wife. He's having a hard time coping. Things are not made any better by his estrangement from his daughter. Senator Palmer from the last season is now President Palmer. When word comes that an Arab terrorist cell has a nuclear device set to go off in Los Angeles TODAY, the president insists that Bauer be brought in on the case. He is reluctant but does so on the condition that his daughter is taken to safety outside the city. President Palmer still seems to be the honest and upstanding guy he was in the last season. He lays down the law to the suspect government without equivocation but also refuses to jump to any conclusions. Jack, on the other hand, is even grittier than before. He will do what it takes to save the city even if it means executing a child molester. The daughter, Kim, continues to further demonstrate her propensity to hook up with losers. She works as a nanny for a little girl. The husband obviously has the hots for her but is a wife beater, daughter beater and nanny beater. It's going to be another long day.. . 9 AM - 10 AM - Kim and the girl she watches over manages to make an escape but the psychopath is after them. There is no indication that he is involved with the terrorists at this point but he's enough to ruin anyone's day. Jack makes contact with the first level of bad guys by cashing in on an old acquaintance who thinks he's another crook. They are suspicious but Jack manages to convince them in a rather unorthodox way that violates lots of civil rights. They are still suspicious. CTU has problems as well. One of the functionaries is frightened enough that she has a hard time doing her job. Worse is the guy who runs the unit. He is frightened and making a beeline to get out of the potential blast radius. That leaves CTU without an effective head. The President has his own problems. He doesn't want to panic the nation but a reporter is suspicious and about to blow up the whole thing on TV. Convincing the reporter to keep the story under wraps is not easy so he gets some civil rights violated as well. There is also a bride with problems. She is about to get married to a guy who might be one of the Middle East terrorists. The supposition is that he is using her as a cover. The bride's sister is suspicious and trying to check up on him but has no real reason to connect him to any plot.. . 10 AM - 11 AM - The psychotic father has reported Kim Bauer as a kidnapper. Kim is still trying to get herself and the girl away from him. She finally calls her father for help but it is a bad time. He is in the car with some terrorists on their way to blow up CTU. Since he is acting weird, she freaks out and calls CTU for help; she takes a bus for CTU. Jack can't get in touch to warn CTU that they are a target because the terrorists have interrupted the phone line. So Jack calls the president to try and get a message through to evacuate the place. Since the president is in the middle of a press conference, a staffer takes the call. She wants to let the president know immediately but another staffer with his own agenda has other plans. He calls CTU to get them to pass all their data along to them. This takes them off of jobs that they need to be doing. As Mason, the cowardly director, tries to flee the blast area, he gets a call to check out a lead. He does divert to check it out and finds part of the trail but is ambushed. These terrorists seem to be of the domestic variety instead of the Arab one. The sister of the bride learns that her suspicions are well founded but is told not to tell anyone else for fear of her endangering her family and herself. She is a poor actress (in this context) and everyone wonders why she is acting so strangely.. . 11 AM - 12 PM - The terrorist bomb got the CTU. Many are dead and others are dying. Kim was walking in right as they started to evacuate. She is alive but the little girl she is caring for starts having seizures because of the beatings from her father. Kim is now a suspect in those beatings. Jack gets the location of the next contact up the line but while doing so has to eliminate those he is with. The guys who blew up the CTU are a bunch of home grown nuts. They know nothing about the nuke and have been duped. Jack finds the guy but he is holed up in his own personal bomb shelter. When he finally believes the plot is real, he takes drastic action but not before he gives Jack one more clue that leads in an unexpected direction. Mason the cowardly leader of the Los Angeles CTU finally shows some guts. Since he has been exposed to a lethal dose of radiation, he has nothing to lose and heads back to take charge and make difficult choices. The president is having trouble with those closest to him. One of his advisors is trying to keep the president in the dark and the other wants to tell him. The one who wants to block it has political and personal power motives. When the president finds out he's been kept in the dark, he is rightfully hacked.  The bridegroom continues to act suspiciously and his soon to be sister in law gets more and more paranoid. The private investigator she hired has set off some red flags and he is taken into custody by the feds.. . 12 PM - 1 PM - The child beating father manages to intimidate both Kim and the mother to keep them from saying anything bad about him. Kim finally manages to get in touch with her father who tells her what is going on. He swears her to secrecy and makes her promise to leave town. She agrees and then promptly gets others involved in an effort to rescue the little girl from the hospital.  The lead provided by Jack's previous suspect leads right to Nina, the mole from last season who killed his wife. She has information but will not say anything until she gets a presidential pardon. The president is inclined to capitulate because the options are worse. Jack learns about this and strong-arms Mason into letting him handle the interrogation. The president is also leaning on the country suspected of funding the terrorists. Against the advice of all, he agrees to an intelligence exchange. As the ambassador is leaving, though, his chopper crashes and he is killed. Meanwhile, CTU is onto the bridegroom and sends someone out to interrogate him. Naturally, the bride freaks out.. . 1 PM - 2 PM - Jack is interrogating Nina to find out more about the plot. His strategy is to convince her that he will kill her and does not care about the consequences. It's effective but gets only limited results. Jack has to take her to meet the next person up the chain. The president is trying to keep the lid on things but having a staff that is infighting among itself proves frustrating. It is even worse when the ex-wife from hell shows up sowing more distrust (which is probably deserved) and making another power grab for herself. The plot to free the child from the hospital gets complicated. Kim is much less adept at these matters than her father but she does show some promise. The interrogation of the bridegroom seems stalled until his parents show up. Then he finally gives up the goods on someone completely unexpected. He may or may not be telling the truth but the CTU agent buys his story.. . 2 PM - 3 PM - Jack sets Nina up to meet her contact. Nobody trusts her. She leads them to her contact but slips her leash for a brief period. The contact is wounded. The president's administration is riven by suspicion. The ex wife is just making things worse. Its to run an investigation when you think that anybody is just waiting to stab you in the back. Mason's symptoms are getting worse. He brings in his son to effect reconciliation before he dies. Kim and her boyfriend are making their escape with the little girl and everything seems to be going in their favor when they get stopped for a traffic violation. The cop is gong to let them go when he notices something dripping from the trunk. It's not ketchup.. . 3 PM - 4 PM - Kim and her boyfriend are arrested for murder. They and the little girl are taken back towards LA. She finally gets the sheriff to get in touch with CTU and Jack. He is on his way back with Nina and one of the terrorists and is distracted by his daughter's pleas for help. He gets further distracted when Nina gets the location of the bomb and kills the terrorist. She is now in a strong bargaining position. The president's wife is worming her way deeper and deeper into intrigue. She convinces the president to let her talk to the reporter being held. The original terrorists finally put in another appearance. They are trying to get their bomb to the right site. They are having a bad day as well. Car trouble and a terrorist who is having second thoughts mess up their original plans. The sister who hired the PI to investigate the Arab groom is worried since her dad is taken into custody. She gets the PI to hack into his files in order to clear him. Instead, things get more suspicious. There is a possible explanation; Dad claims to be an agent as well. It becomes moot when unknown parties abduct the sister and the PI. All the attempts at secrecy start to fall apart when the reporter somehow gets free and goes live with a panic story. About this time, the plane with Jack and Nina starts to fall out of the air.. . 4 PM - 5 PM - Recordings show that the president's ex wife was not the one who let the reporter go. It was a fired staffer. This seemingly clears the wife but don't be too sure about that. The plane with Jack and Nina has crashed. They are both alive and search and rescue is on the way. Some well armed soldiers show up first and they are trouble. The only thing that might save Jack and Nina is his Special Forces background. This gives Nina a chance to get the drop on Jack and make more demands. She wants a pardon for the murder of Jack in return for information on the location of the bomb. The sister and her PI have been abducted by the head honcho terrorist. They want to know what they found in her father's files and torture IS an option. The only thing that might be in her favor is that the address given up by Nina might be the one where she is being held. The father of the bride is looking more and more guilty and the Arab groom is looking more and more innocent. That makes the bride believe that her fianc has turned on her dad. It is a no win situation for grooms. At least the beaten little girl seems to be getting to safety. The same cannot be said of Kim and her boyfriend.. . 5 PM - 6 PM - The distrust in the president's cabinet is raised even higher when Jack reports that he was attacked by US troops from a unit run by the NSA. The president is inclined to arrest the director but his ex wife persuades him to wait until he has more proof. She is making herself more and more valuable but the snake is not to be trusted. Kim and her boyfriend are being transported to the LA jail but manage to stage an attempt to get away. She does but others are not so lucky. Jack takes down the address given to him by Nina with a rescue squad. He manages to rescue the sister of the bride but the bad guy swallows a cyanide capsule and that source of information is lost. The big bad guy is still at large. Things start coming together but they are confusing. The bride has a big surprise for everyone, especially the groom.. . 6 PM - 7 PM - The blushing bride is up to her eyeballs in the nuclear plot. Presumably her father is as well. There is also some suspicion about the sister but Jack thinks she is clean. The ex wife of the president is up to her eyeballs in the plot against the president's administration. She gets the head of the NSA, one of her cohorts, arrested. The president knows something is fishy. He authorizes some unsavory and extra legal methods to get information. An assault on a mosque known to have the head terrorist winds up without the quarry. Meanwhile, the bad sister (bride) manages to get the nuclear triggers. Kim doesn't get very far in her bid to get away. She finds a large cat who considers her to be a tasty and nutritious way to end the day.. . 7 PM - 8 PM - The terrorist does not get away, as seemed would happen and Jack uses the same interrogation philosophy used by the president but his methods are even uglier. The bride's sister finds out that the bride has been implicated in the murder of the groom and the terrorist plot. She doesn't want to believe it but agrees to set up a cell phone trace. Dad doesn't want to believe it either but fills in some information about her past. Just when things don't seem to be able to get any uglier, Jack gets the information he needs. The bomb is at an airport. Evidence begins to mount that the rat in his office is his ex wife. That further ratchets up the tension.  A rescuer finds Kim and likes what he sees.. . 8 PM - 9 PM - The corrupt head of the NSA finally breaks under interrogation and confirms the location of the bomb. He also reveals the existence of a rogue US paramilitary force that will kill anyone who gets in the way of their getting the bomb. Jack finds them but they are dead. They have been executed by somebody. Kim's rescuer turns out to be a nut in his own right. He's a survivalist and has is own personal bomb shelter with quite an arms cache. He's been looking forward to a bomb burst for some time. Getting Kim into his bomb shelter raises expectations. Bureaucrats from CTU are worried about the bombed out base of operations and want to move things up to their office. George Mason, the irradiated head of the local office, steps forward and won't let them do it. They have too many operations in play at the moment. The higher ups have heard that he is no longer able to run things but he puts on a good face. He is failing fast, though.  The NSA director, while being confronted lets slip that there is one more commando unaccounted for but fails to let them know that the ex wife is part of the plot. Jack and his team manage to stop the plane with the bomb but it is a decoy. The bomb is still in play. When the NSA director learns about this, he does point the finger.. . 9 PM - 10 PM - CTU has the pilot of the plane but he claims that he was doing it for his family. They were to be paid when he blew himself up. He claims not to know about the bomb being a dummy or about the location of the real one. The sister of the bride has proven most helpful thus far but she is nave. When she sees her sister, she runs to find her and try to get things \"straightened out\". She does not count on her sister being willing to kill her to get her badge. Luckily, Jack is not nave. The president confronts his ex wife and, reluctantly, she admits that she has been plotting but she claims not to know about how the plans have unraveled. She might even be telling the truth but her track record is against her. Kim's rescuer gets more and more exited. He is looking forward to repopulating the world which doesn't need populating. His lies begin to unravel and she gets suspicious. George Mason comes to the point where he knows he can't do the job any more because of the radiation sickness. He bows out and turns things over to Tony and is a real class act. The episode ends with them finding the bomb. At least that is what we are supposed to believe. With this series, though, all we can be sure of is that everyone is probably wrong.. . 10 PM - 11 PM - The bomb has a little less than an hour before it goes off. Jack decides to fly it as far from LA as possible. There are two options. One is to head out to sea and the other is to head for the desert. Each has drawbacks. The desert is chosen. It is a suicide run. Jack is planning on flying it himself but he has a stowaway. Because of that, he may survive after all. CTU has a diplomatic problem. They are cracking information on a terrorist hard drive which implicate three foreign governments. Many people are urging the president to prepare for war but there is the possibility that the allegations are false. Only time will tell and time is running out. Time does run out on the bomb with the inevitable consequences.. . 11 PM - 12 AM - The bomb has gone off and Jack is alive. The big problem at present is that there is some belief that three foreign governments were part of the plot. Strangely enough, there is reason to believe him but there is much evidence to contradict him. There is the distinct possibility that the governments are being framed. CTU assessment gets garbled when it gets passed to the president and it looks like the US is going to war. Jack is asked to further interrogate the prime suspect to determine if he is lying and he agrees to do so but he is distracted by concern for his daughter. He gets an answer but the terrorist is assassinated moments later. Could this be the last member of the rogue US team? Whoever it is, he is offering Jack evidence that the recordings implicating the foreign governments are is faked. The price is breaking the bride's sister out of CTU. Kim thinks her dad is dead and she is trying to figure out what to do. She goes into a closed store to use the bathroom and the craziness is just beginning. People are trying to rob the store and the chaos factor grows.. . 12 AM - 1 AM - Jack breaks Kate out of CTU in order to try and find out about the possibility of the evidence against the unnamed middle eastern countries being fabricated. This makes Jack a suspicious character in CTU's eyes.  The cabinet is pushing for war but the president will not back down from his insistence that they must get this right. This makes others think he is losing his nerve and the plotting begins to thicken. Jack finds the missing 7th member of the strike team. He wants Kate as a hostage to ensure his getaway. He says he has evidence that a business cartel arranged the plot. Jack sees no choice but to make the transfer. All seems to go well then all are ambushed by parties unknown. The situation at the convenience store has gotten out of hand. A man has been killed and Kim is being held hostage until the police take the wife of the killer a safe distance from the city.. . 1 AM - 2 AM - Getting out of the ambush set of for Jack and his source takes a lot of effort. He requires the help from inside CTU but his source is under suspicion. They manage to get away but the head guy is shot in the escape. Only he can tell where the information is and he refuses to go to a hospital. Eventually he realizes he is dying and starts to tell Jack where the information is hidden but he waits too long. Kim still thinks her dad is dead and has been taken into custody by the LA county sheriff's office. Now with events the way they are, the authorities are inclined to believe her earlier story but she is still in trouble for some of the escape attempt. The president is dealing with problems as well. His cabinet is being less than fully supportive and is second guessing him. The military is unsatisfied with the way things are being done and rioting is beginning to break out in the east. Shootings by the National Guard only make matters worse.. . 2 AM - 3 AM - Jack finds a tracking device in the chip with the evidence. He sends the evidence with Kate and the foreign agent to get back to CTU. He takes the tracker himself to decoy the hostiles in a different direction. His distraction works but he gets caught. That sets up another torture scenario with Jack on the receiving end. The hidden powers want the evidence suppressed and a great deal of money rides on it. Things at CTU are starting to fall apart. Personal agendas and family relations are tearing working relationships apart.  The president's cabinet has been summoned to a secret meeting. It looks like the Vice President is staging a coup.. . 3 AM - 4 AM - The torture keeps getting worse for Bauer and he still refuses to give up the information the terrorists want. He does manage to get free and get a name for the higher ups. Kate and the foreign intelligence officer are about to head to CTU when they get caught by some hysterical people looking to kill Arabs. The guy gets a beating and robbed and the thugs get the chip. Kate offers them money if she can get the chip back and they take her to her house for the payoff. The president's loyal advisor is critically injured as she tries to escape the custody one of those holding her. The president is suspicious but unaware that his NSA director is at the heart of the plot. The vice president is as bad as the ex wife about being a power hungry @$$. . 4 AM - 5 AM - Jack gets the chip and tries to transmit the data but the chip is damaged. He tries to get some CTU types to clean up the data but there is a power grab in process by some types working with the vice president. The president also has problems. He is on trial by his cabinet. The VP is going for broke and has perjured testimony ready. The vote is ugly. The results are uglier. The one slim hope is to find the guy who actually did the forgery work. Jack heads that way. What he finds is the ugliest thing yet.. . 5 AM - 6 AM - The president is relieved and the VP takes over. Planes are on the way and the beginning of the war is imminent. Power struggles within the cabinet leave enough uncertainty for the president to get a Secret Service agent working on his side. Power struggles within CTU also hang things up. Jack's only source of help is relieved of duty. Jack has found not only the guy who doctored the tapes but the BIGGEST TRAITOR OF ALL. The traitor is still trying to wheel and deal and the geek is worried about the future. He doesn't want to go to jail and is frightened. He doesn't know whether to trust Jack or the traitor. He gives the traitor a knife and Jack the slip. Kim Bauer finally makes another significant part of the story line. She is laboring under the delusion that everything will now be fine and the bits and pieces are being mopped up. A deputy takes her to her former employer's house to pick up her things. The wife beater is hiding out there. Kim learns that sometimes life is nasty and survival is nastier.. . 6 AM - 7 AM - Jack catches up with the fleeing computer geek but not before he manages to critically hurt himself. CTU sends a chopper to pick him up but the political types call it off before the pickup can be made. This has severe health consequences for the geek. That means that Jack has to rely on the traitor. He wants the rat to set up a meet with the big guys to try and get evidence. Jacks biggest problem besides being stuck with a traitor, and needing to stop a war is that he has been damaged by the torture. That lowers his effectiveness and he has to trust the least trustworthy person in the entire series.  The VP's government needs a deal too. Some of the bombers have been spotted and the Turks want to talk to Palmer personally. The VP needs him to pretend like he is still the president. That is the only way to save the American aircrews. After showing a bit of spunk, Kim is now in shock over shooting the guy that wanted to kill her. Jack sends Kate to pick her up but Kim doesn't know or trust Kate.. . 7 AM - 8 AM - The president's lawyer finds some corroborating evidence. This makes the president's chief of staff have second thoughts. He orders CTU to help Bauer. That gets Bauer's associates off the hook but  Bauer is struggling to get to the meet and he thinks he is unsupported. When he finally makes contact, time is running out. He has to trust the arch traitor to wear a wire. Kim and Kate make it to CTU. Jack the traitor goes through with the meet live and on the air. They get the evidence but who knows whether the VP wants to accept it. That's a political problem. Jack's problem is that the stress causes problems with his heart. All of the goals seem to be met but things are set up for further trouble. The ending is the real surprise.", "timestamp": 1142899200, "rating": 5.0, "sentiment": 0.0317923578072093, "overall": 7.5794808945180225, "wordCount": 1090, "customer": {"customerId": "AQBRMBQ99ESI7", "name": "John A Lee III", "cluster": 0}, "product": {"asin": "B00008YGRU", "title": "24: Season 2", "brand": "Kiefer Sutherland", "imageUrl": null, "price": 12.99, "categories": ["Boxed Sets", "Action & Adventure"], "avgRating": 4.688543076229139, "avgSentiment": 0.399622261763831, "avgOverall": 8.187598730638717, "reviewCount": 4434}}]}]
