They didn't understand Matrix at first, either.. . I didn't know there was a series before I saw the movie. People who say it didn't make sense at first are too used to brainless Hollywood flicks, serving you a formulaic plot on a platter.. . This plot was not difficult to understand - the movie asks for your patience the first 30 minutes, as the story unfolds. It's a futuristic mystery, people! Get real - how lazy must you be if you lose interest because everything isn't explained immediately. It's a mildly (and pleasantly) complex story. If you want a Steven Siegal or Schwarzenegger action flick, look elsewhere.. . And only the first half of the movie is the \"mystery\". It takes about an hour for the plot, the characters, and the futuristic setting to unfold. Then the movie evolves into a stunning action flick.. . Thing I loved about this movie:. . -Srong female characters. . -Excellent soundtrack. . -Extremely interesting visually. . -Extremely creative sci-fi contributions (like the arm-to-leg transplants). . -Thoughtful cinematography. . -A very strong cast. . -Artistic sets & effects. . -Creative weapons & futuristic props. . -A truly unique story - it didn't try to copy anything (which probably confused the Hollywood lemmings out there). . My only complaint - it needed more in spots. Particularly, more character development for other members of the resistance. If you've seen it...I believe they jumped the gun getting to the last \"sniper\" scene. I wanted them to invest more time developing the animosity between Aeon Flux & the resistance movement.. .

Director Roy Rowland's 'GUNFIGHTERS OF CASA GRANDE' aka 'PISTOLEROS DE CASA GRANDE '-1964 is a US/Spanish co-production with all the trimmings of a dull, 'B' oater of the fifties.  An outlaw wins a cattle ranch in a poker game which fuels his plan of consolidating his cattle with the area ranchers cattle thereby selling them to the US for rip-off prices and then sharing the spoils with his gang.  His plans go awry when a Mexican bandit and his gang decide to spoil the party and the usual gunfight ensues.  It all sounds better on paper for it takes a good deal of dull talk and dated shenanigans between the actors to finally come to the climactic shootout  (60 minutes to be exact) .  The reason the film is lacklustre is due to the cast.  Alex Nichol is cast as the lead which is wrong because Nichol cannot carry the film and since he's such a sleaze bucket, its hard to relate to him.  Nichol was great as the villain in Director Anthony Mann's classic 'THE MAN FROM LARAMIE'-1955 and would also direct some films and TV shows including 'THE SCREAMING SKULL'1958 but here he is just a loud mouth braggart.  The great Aldo Sambrell who would grace many a Spaghetti Western including his best role in Director Sergio Corbucci's 'NAVAJO JOE' aka 'UN DOLLARO A TESTA'-1966 glides through his Mexican bandito villainy in a cranky mood looking like he doesn't want to be there.  This is all the fault of Director Roy Rowland who's career was peppered with minor gems including 'THE 5000 FINGERS OF DR. T'-1953.  His stagy set ups and wooden camera movement really tests the audiences patience.  The script is by Borden Chase who gave the Western genre some true classics including Director Anthony Mann's 'WINCHESTER 73'-1950 and Director Robert Aldrich's 'VERA CRUZ'-1954 but here its just a routine outing.  Fans will spot Euro actors Antonio Mayans and the beautiful Diana Lorys who both worked with Director Jess Franco. The quality of the release is the reason for the 3 stars.

THE DEVIL COMMANDS opens onto a dark and stormy night with a sad sounding woman, the Mad Scientist's daughter, providing a voice-over narration. The narrator throws us into a deep flashback where a happy Dr. Boris Karloff is showing off his new invention, a primitive electroencephlogram gadget (the EEG was developed in the 1930s, so this is relatively new technology) that features a six foot tall, wall mounted graph.  The person whose brain is being scanned is fitted with a head strap that's covered with what looks to be a deep sea diving helmet.

The crowd of admiring fellow scientists are wowed by the machine, dismissive of the planned application.. .

He insists on giving the baby to Jenna and the Winchesters, naming her Amara before he dies. Dean is haunted by a vision of The Darkness telling him he set her free and they are now linked into always helping each other. Dean wants to kill the infected and escape with the baby but Sam wants to try and cure them. Sam acts as a diversion allowing Dean and Jenna to escape, though Sam gets infected. Castiel struggles to control himself from inflicting more violence due to Rowena's attack dog spell, and is captured by two angels when he begs for help. Crowley regroups after narrowly escaping Castiel's attempt on his life, hearing that The Darkness has set off ancient alarms in both Heaven and Hell.

However, Amara begins levitating her toy blocks and Jenna's religious grandmother calls an exorcist while Jenna calls Dean. Dean arrives to find the \"exorcist\" to be Crowley who explains that he senses an ancient darkness in the child. At the same time, Jenna visits Amara and then suddenly murders her grandmother. Investigating the noise, Dean finds the Mark of Cain on Amara and remembering it on the woman from his vision, realizes that Amara is the Darkness. Confronting Jenna, Crowley realizes that she is now soulless, Amara having consumed her soul. Dean and Jenna fight before Crowley kills her. Crowley reveals he intends to use Amara for his own purposes, but Dean incapacitates him only to find Amara, now grown into a young girl, gone. Crowley later approaches Amara with people for her to feed on. At the same time, two angels torture Castiel before Hannah saves him. When he asks about the location of the Winchesters, Castiel realizes it was a ruse to get information from him. The other two angels try to hack his mind, but Rowena's spell gives him the strength to break free and fight back. Castiel kills the other two angels, but not before they kill Hannah. An infected Sam works to find a cure to the Darkness' poisoning with little luck. He encounters a Reaper who informs him that him and Dean will be thrown into a void when they die and that he is \"unclean in a biblical sense.\" As a result, Sam researches purifications from the Bible and finds a reference to holy oil. Using holy fire, Sam is able to cure himself and then save the remaining people in the town. Returning to the bunker, he and Dean find Castiel begging for help.. . 3 \"The Bad Seed\". Sam and Dean search for Rowena to cure Castiel as well as begin to try to find Metatron before the other angels do, for information on The Darkness. A demon tries to kill Rowena while she is attempting and failing to recruit witches for her Mega Coven, leading the Winchesters to her. Though they take the Codex from her she has hidden The Book of the Damned. Castiel loses control as the attack dog spell takes him over and goes rogue. While searching for him Rowena reveals the deal Sam made with her to kill Crowley if she removed the Mark of Cain from Dean, though Dean understands. Dean saves a woman from Castiel and is attacked by the angel. Rowena restores Castiel to normal and escapes. A low level demon and angel commiserate at a bar that the leaders of Heaven and Hell don't appear to be doing anything about The Darkness.

Sam has a dream where someone or something appears to him as a younger John Winchester, telling him he and Dean have to stop The Darkness and: \"God helps those who help themselves.\" Sam thinks this and his other vision from when he was infected mean God is helping them, though Dean is skeptical. Sam is attacked while trying to talk to the victim's wife while Dean is attacked by the replacement sheriff's deputy and finds out shooting it with silver and beheading it doesn't kill it. A call from Castiel explains it is a Nachzehrer, a ghoul and vampire-like creature. The wife wakes up and has been turned, kidnapping Dean in the car. She explains she killed her husband for not joining them and the new deputy is the alpha. The alpha is restored and explains he is scared of The Darkness so he is building an army. He will turn Sam, who is walking into a trap, and then they will eat Dean. Dean gets free and shoves copper pennies down the alpha's throat and decapitates him with the Impala's door, killing him and returning his victims to normal humans. Both bruised Winchesters agree to stop The Darkness after they heal, driving off in the battered Impala.. . 5 \"Thin Lizzie\". A young couple is killed in a hotel that used to be the home of Lizzie Borden. Sam and Dean quickly find all the paranormal signs in the hotel are fakes for the tourists. However, one of the hotel owners is killed, along with a man miles away from the hotel who is found by Sidney, the babysitter of his son Jordie. The wife Dawn has an unemotional reaction to her husband's death. Dean meets Len a Lizzie Borden fan who says he saw a girl named Amara wandering outside the hotel a few nights ago and he hasn't felt normal since he met her. Dean realizes Amara ate Len's soul. Suspecting Dawn to be soulless as well, the Winchesters find her and her lover dead in a house with Jordie tied up. Sidney captures the Winchesters explaining she also met Amara, who said she wanted to help Sidney. Sidney has felt blissful ever since her soul was taken, Amara helping her not care about her abusive childhood. Sidney killed her enemies and Jordie's parents for being abusive and plans to offer the Winchesters to Amara as a gift. Len saves the Winchesters by killing Sidney. Len can feel himself turning darker the longer he is without a soul so he turns himself in for all the murders to stop himself. The Winchesters send Jordie to an aunt and are concerned about Amara growing stronger. Amara watches them as they leave promising to see Dean soon.. . 6 \"Our Little World\". Amara eats the soul of a teenager named Goldie and ages slightly upward again. Crowley grounds Amara for sneaking out to eat and tries to convince her that he can be a father and teacher for her, while having her soulless victims killed to keep her a secret. Dean and Sam are still in the area and are called in once Len is killed in jail. Goldie is arrested and the Winchesters capture the assassin meant for her. After killing him, they track Crowley and Amara to an abandoned asylum to kill Amara. Sam fights off several demons while avoiding killing most of them to try and save the human hosts; he also has another vision. Crowley prepares to kill Dean but Amara stops him, declaring she doesn't need him and tortures Crowley into letting Dean go. Amara knows Dean won't kill her because of their link and says she'll soon be strong enough to exact her revenge on God. Meanwhile, Castiel sees Metatron on television and tracks him down, taking the demon tablet. Metatron is stuck as a human and films tragedies to sell to the media for money. Sensing a rage within Castiel, Metatron constantly mocks him, hoping to be killed since he hates being human. Castiel resists this, and gets Metatron to reveal that in order to make the world, God had to sacrifice His sister, The Darkness. Castiel deems Metatron harmless and lets him leave, to the Winchesters' shock. Dean lies and says Amara overpowered him. Sam is horrified to realize his visions are of The Cage where Michael and Lucifer are locked inside.. . 7 \"Plush\". After a man is murdered by someone in a bunny mask that won't come off, Sheriff Donna Hanscum calls in the Winchesters for help. After learning that the killer suddenly changed after putting the mask on, they come to believe it is a cursed object. Donna's deputy Doug is forced to kill the young man to save Donna and she and the Winchesters burn the mask and believe it to be over. However, a young woman in a jester mascot outfit brutally attacks the local football coach before being stopped by the school quarterback. After the quarterback tells them that the room suddenly got cold, the Winchesters realize they are dealing with a ghost who is possessing the various costumes and those who wear them. Using rock salt, they are able to free the latest possession victim, who tells them that the costume had recently been donated to the school. The Winchesters and Donna learn that the costumes belonged to a children's performer named Chester Johnson and after his suicide, his sister donated all of his costumes. Realizing Chester is the ghost, Donna and Doug collect all of the costumes and burn them while Dean talks to the first victim's widow and learns that Chester supposedly molested the children of the two victims. At the same time, Sam is unable to stop Chester from possessing another innocent victim and using him to finish off the coach. Chester's sister Rita explains that after she was confronted with the accusations of child molestation, she worried about her own son and helped the two men get to Chester to scare him. In doing so, Chester was accidentally killed and now wants revenge. Possessing Rita's son through the last costume, Chester attacks but Dean is able to remove the costume and Sam burns it, destroying Chester. At the same time, Sam prays to God for guidance on his visions and explains to Dean he thinks that they mean he has to return to Lucifer's Cage and that the answer to The Darkness may be there.. . 8 \"Just My Imagination\". A little girl's imaginary friend, Sparkle the unicorn-man, is killed. Sam is shocked to wake up and see his own childhood imaginary friend Sully is real. Sully explains he and Sparkle are Zn who appear to lonely children to cheer them up. Sully had done so for Sam when he wasn't allowed to go on hunts with John and Dean. Sully thought Sam wanted to be something other then a hunter and encouraged him to run away. However, John changed his mind and allowed Sam to join them so Sam rejects Sully as fake and Sully leaves hurt. Sully allows Sam and Dean to see his kind to help catch the killer, but a mermaid imaginary friend is also killed. A third one is stabbed but survives and contacts Sully for help. While Dean tracks the killer, Sam apologizes to Sully and explains his fear of returning to Lucifer's Cage. Sully forgives him and says even heroes can be scared, but they are the only ones brave enough to do what needs to be done. The killer captures Dean, and is revealed to be a young woman named Reese. Reese and her twin sister Audrey were Sully's next children after Sam, but Audrey was killed by a car while playing tag in the street with Sully. Reese read the folklore and paid a witch for the ability to see Zn and a blade that can kill Sully's kind as revenge. Sully offers to die if that is what Reese needs, though the brothers talk her out of killing him. Sully agrees to check in on Reese and wishes Sam luck. Sam admits to Dean he thinks he has to go to the Cage. Dean says there must be another way, but has no idea what that could be.. . 9 \"O Brother Where Art Thou?\". A fully grown Amara kills religious preachers in a park and a church as attempts to get God's attention, dismissing religion as manipulation. Finally convincing Dean following the visions are their only choice, Sam and Dean approach Crowley for a way to communicate with Lucifer in The Cage. Crowley has Rowena captured to read from the Book of the Damned for this purpose and they form a tense alliance. Alone, Dean investigates the church deaths and senses Amara. She transports him away to talk, claiming she only wants to hurt God who supposedly exiled her because she might be better at making creations. She claims that she would rule the world to give everyone bliss like Dean feels with her. After Dean's attempt to stab her fails, Amara kisses Dean saying they are meant to be together ever since he freed her. A low level angel rallies all the angels in Heaven against Amara. He and two others go to arrest her, saying if she resists the combined might of every angel will kill her. Amara kills the three angels and sends Dean back to safety as the sky opens up and strikes her. The others proceed with the plan and Rowena wards The Cage while Sam speaks with Lucifer. Lucifer says The Darkness is equal to God in raw power and offers help if Sam agrees to be his vessel again. Sam refuses as the warding fails to Crowley's shock, though Rowena remains calm. Sam is pulled into The Cage where Lucifer reveals the release of The Darkness weakened The Cage and he's been the one sending Sam's visions and that God was never helping them.. . 10 \"The Devil in the Details\". Lucifer recently approached Rowena in a dream, promising her rewards if she helps him get to Sam. Dean searches for Sam and is sent by Crowley to Billie the Reaper who Sam had encountered recently. Billie lets Dean into Hell with a \"witch collar\" that allows Crowley to control Rowena. Castiel and a low level angel search to see if Amara survived while the angel points out Castiel is more expendable than the Winchesters. Amara survived and kills the other angel, then sends Castiel to Billie with a threat carved into his chest, though the effort of that does appear to weaken her. Meanwhile Lucifer says Sam has gone soft. Last time he fought him, he sacrificed himself to save the world. In recent years Sam and Dean only want to save each other regardless of the cost. Lucifer says making a sacrifice and being his vessel is the only way to stop The Darkness, since God is gone, Gabriel and Raphael are dead, and Michael has supposedly gone insane while imprisoned. Sam refuses, not believing its guaranteed Lucifer would win against Amara and even if it was, he'd then destroy the world himself. Lucifer pulls Dean and Castiel into The Cage and beats all three of them, though Rowena's spell seems to work to send him away. The brothers agree to find another way to stop Amara while Castiel hangs back. Castiel, having said yes at the last second to be Lucifer's vessel, goes to confront Crowley and Rowena. Lucifer makes sure Rowena is the only one who could open The Cage again and kills her, then saying he wants to talk to Crowley.. . 11 \"Into the Mystic\". Thirty years ago in Ireland, a man is killed after hearing a strange noise and being attacked. His wife banishes the creature but also dies, leaving only their baby alive. In the present day Sam and Dean investigate a case in a retirement home where one of the residents died in a similar manner. A resident named Mildred sees the creature commit its second kill of the building manager. The brothers realize the creature is a Banshee, driving its victims insane with its voice before feeding on their brains. Sam is briefly captured by a deaf woman posing as a housekeeper named Marleen. Marleen was the baby who was raised by a hunter after her parents died, her real name is Aileen and her grandfather was a Men of Letters. The banshee's screams also destroyed her hearing. Posing as Castiel, Lucifer searches the bunker for a way to kill Amara and Dean admits his connection to her but asks to keep it a secret from Sam. \"Castiel\" agrees saying maybe they can use this to draw Amara out. Assuming Mildred is the next target, the Winchesters and Aileen protect her but are caught off guard when the banshee targets Dean. Mildred and Aileen are able to kill it. Aileen continues hunting while Mildred assumes Dean is attracted to someone out there. Later, Sam admits how Lucifer taunted him and apologizes for not looking for Dean while he was in Purgatory. Dean had forgiven him a long time ago. Sam is able to rest soundly, but Dean is still tormented by his thoughts.. . 12 \"Don't You Forget About Me\". Sam and Dean are called in by Claire Novak, now living with Sheriff Jody Mills and Alex, saying she has a case. However, Jody says Claire has attacked innocent people in a series of false alarms and is ignoring college, devoting everything to hunting. Meanwhile Alex is doing well in high school with a jock boyfriend Henry. Claire claims the disappearances of three local people must be a case. Both Winchesters caution her at diving too fast into hunting and say she should be more appreciative of Jody. Alex's favorite teacher is killed and hung up the flag pole. Realizing the case is real, the Winchesters learn the school janitor is a vampire, who kidnaps Jody and Claire. Henry is also a vampire and takes Alex. The janitor is named Rich, he was a trucker who had tried to help Alex while she was still bait for the vampire nest. Rich was turned and then killed his own wife. Rich tracked Alex down, but seeing her misery, he turned Henry and sent him to be her boyfriend to make her happy and then kill her new family of Jody and Claire. Rich and Henry had been feeding on the missing people, Henry killed the teacher as the first step to hurt Alex. The Winchesters bust in, Claire distracts Rich, allowing Dean to behead him, while Sam lets Claire and Alex kill Henry. The girls show more appreciation to Jody for protecting them, while Claire still wants to be a hunter and Alex wants to focus on her studies for a normal life. The Winchesters leave them as a newly united family.. . 13 \"Love Hurts\". In Hudson, Ohio, a babysitter named Stacey is having an affair with her married boss Dan. Stacey's heart is ripped out while looking after his baby alone. Dan admits the affair to Dean and shows him nanny-cam footage that reveals \"Dan\" killed Stacey. The brothers think it's a shapeshifter but then \"Stacey\" kills Dan in his office. Dan's wife Melissa knew about the affair but wanted to work things out. Her hairdresser Sonya claimed to be a white witch and gave Melissa a love spell to make Dan fall for her again. The spell is actually a curse, transferred by kissing and is working its way back to the spell-caster, Melissa. \"Dan\" tries to kill her but Dean kisses her, making the spell target him. Breaking into Sonya's barber shop, the brothers learn the spell summons a Qareen, which has a heart separate from its body and kills while appearing as its victim's greatest desire. Sam investigates upstairs and is captured by Sonya while Dean is attacked in the basement by \"Amara\". Dean is able to fight back since the Qareen is not really her. Sonya explains she uses the curse to punish cheating men and the stupid women who still love them. Melissa distracts Sonya, allowing Sam to kill her and stab the Qareen's heart, destroying it. Dean admits to Sam that he desires Amara when he is around her and doesn't think he can kill her even though he wants to. Sam promises he will kill Amara for both of them.. . 14 \"The Vessel\". In Occupied France in 1943, a Woman of Letters named Delphine Seydoux kills a Nazi general and steals a powerful artifact from him. In the present, Sam discovers that the artifact is a Hand of God and possibly has the power to destroy Amara. Sam and Dean call upon Castiel for information, not knowing he is possessed by Lucifer who has regained control of Hell but lacks the power to defeat Amara. As the Bluefin, the submarine carrying the Hand of God to America sank, Dean has Lucifer transport him into the past to before the sinking, but special warding keeps Lucifer out. Dean locates Delphine and manages to convince her of his mission, but a German destroyer attacks the Bluefin, commanded by the German general who is a member of the Thule Society. In the present, Sam finds a spell that will allow \"Castiel\" to remove the warding and offers to use his soul to power it. Lucifer reveals himself and nearly kills Sam, but Castiel manages to regain control long enough to stop him and inform Sam of the situation. Unable to defeat the Germans, Delphine unleashes the power of the Hand of God, obliterating the Bluefin and her crew as Lucifer returns Dean to the present. Lucifer reveals himself to Dean and attempts to use the Hand of God, but discovers that its power is expended. As Lucifer is distracted, Sam banishes him with a blood sigil. Dean promises to capture Lucifer and free Castiel who he refuses to believe willingly agreed to possession. Sam informs him that while the wreckage of the Bluefin was never recovered, the German destroyer was found, sunk by the Hand of God, leaving Dean contemplating the sacrifices committed by the Bluefin and her crew.. . 15 \"Beyond the Mat\". After one of their favorite wrestlers apparently commits suicide, Sam and Dean go to pay their respects only for a man at the memorial wrestling show to get murdered with a strange symbol etched into his body. The two quickly figure out that they are dealing with a demon who is collecting souls, but find that none of the wrestlers are possessed. One of the wrestlers, Harley, is kidnapped by one of his fellow wrestlers, Gunner Lawless, who is working for a crossroads demon who is collecting souls to create his own \"nest egg\" because of the appearance of the Darkness and Lucifer's return. The demon overpowers the Winchesters and orders Lawless to kill Dean. Lawless explains that he had made a deal ten years before and the demon had promised to spare his life if he did its bidding. Dean is able to convince Lawless to help and Lawless frees Dean and kills the demon. Sam and Dean leave Lawless to face the hellhounds at his request. Dean is more determined than ever to stop Lucifer and Amara and to save Castiel. At the same time, Lucifer searches for another Hand of God with no luck. Crowley escapes with the help of another demon and leads her to where he has stashed the Rod of Aaron. The demon turns out to be working for Lucifer, but Crowley expends the Rod's power trying to kill Lucifer and is forced to flee.. . 16 \"Safe House\". In Grand Rapids, Michigan, a mother is renovating her house when her daughter's bedroom shows signs of a ghost and the girl falls into a coma with a hand-print on her ankle, and the same thing soon happens to her mother. Sam and Dean investigate, discovering Bobby and Rufus had been to the same house around seven years ago to save a mother and son. Told as parallel stories, Bobby and Rufus already burned the bones of any possible ghost but that doesn't solve the problem. Both pairs realize it is a soul eater, an undead being which takes souls to a nest that exists outside of space and time, resembling the house it haunts, while leaving the human bodies to die. Bobby and Rufus don't know how to kill it so they settle for a trap to seal it, which Bobby had previously used in another home in Tennessee. This same seal was broken during the renovations at the start of the Winchesters case. Sam is able to use information from The Men of Letters to find another seal that will kill it, but someone must also place it in the nest. Both Dean and Bobby are taken into the nest and are soon possessed by the soul eater, attacking their partner in the real world. Sam and Rufus fight them off, defeating the soul eater and saving the mothers and children. Due to the nature of the nest, Bobby and Dean's souls are able to see each other just before they wake up. In the past, Bobby heads off to follow a lead on Lilith, while in the present the brothers go off to finish Bobby's case in Tennessee.. . 17 \"Red Meat\". Sam and Dean investigate a werewolf case that leads to Sam getting shot while rescuing a young couple, Corbin and Michelle. Unknown to anyone, Corbin has been bitten and is slowly transforming into a werewolf himself. As Dean refuses to leave Sam, Corbin suffocates Sam, seemingly killing him in order to force Dean to abandon his brother. Dean is able to get the two to the hospital where he kills himself with a drug overdose in hopes of convincing a Reaper to bring Sam back. Dean is successfully able to draw in the Reaper Billie who refuses to deal and reveals that Sam is still alive. Before she can take him to the Empty, a doctor is able to revive Dean with adrenaline. At the same time, Sam wakes up and discovers the surviving werewolves have arrived. Sam kills the werewolves and calls Dean to warn him about Corbin. Corbin kills a doctor and a deputy before Dean stops him from hurting Michelle. Corbin nearly kills Dean, but Sam arrives in time to kill Corbin and save his brother. The doctors are able to save Sam and determine that when Corbin tried to kill Sam, his body went into shock and he simply appeared dead. Michelle is devastated by Corbin's death while Dean lies to Sam about what he did while he thought his brother was dead.. . 18 \"Hell's Angel\". Crowley secures The Horn of Joshua as the next Hand of God to kill Amara. He calls the Winchesters in to discuss terms. He wants Lucifer sealed back in The Cage first, while Sam wants to use Lucifer and the Horn to kill Amara, and Dean wants Castiel freed first. Meanwhile, Lucifer intimidates the angels of Heaven into working with him to stop Amara. Amara is recovering from the angel's attack with the help of Rowena, who was revived by her inner magic after Lucifer broke her neck. Amara sends a vocal attack into Heaven, scaring everyone; including Rowena who reveals herself to Crowley and the brothers to open The Cage again. Baiting Lucifer with the Horn, the brothers and Crowley try to convince Castiel to force Lucifer out, but Castiel refuses and just wants to wait for the battle with Amara. Lucifer breaks free and attacks the Winchesters; Crowley uses the opportunity to escape. Amara arrives and, after Lucifer is unable to hurt her with the Horn, captures him and releases the Winchesters, while Rowena escapes. The Winchesters move past their disagreement about Castiel and try to think of another way, theorizing that since Lucifer had fallen he couldn't use a Hand of God's full power. Amara decides to draw out God by torturing an archangel, making Lucifer/Castiel scream in agony.. . 19 \"The Chitters\". In 1989, two brothers Jessy and Matty, are fishing in the woods when Matty is abducted by someone with green eyes. In the present, Sam and Dean are called in when the same thing begins happening in the same town. Witnesses report one of the creatures appeared naked while their friend appeared to be shaking and buzzing when they saw them. Speaking with a local, the Winchesters learn of \"the Chitters\" superstition, where people have orgies in the woods and then disappear. Dean is attacked in the forest but saved by two hunters, Cesar and an adult Jessy. They explain that these monsters, revealed as cicada-like creatures called Bisaan, reappear every 27 years and use human bodies to mate for a few days. The hosts die off once the eggs are laid and the next generation hatches underground to repeat the process. While Cesar and Dean search for the burrow in the woods, Sam and Jessy confront the sheriff from 27 years ago. The sheriff had attacked the burrow but saw his own daughter was turned and was forced to kill her. Wanting to hide what happened, he told Jessy he was just a crazy kid, enraging him. Dean and Cesar find the burrow in a mine and kill the Bisaan, however the current hosts are already dead so they burn down the eggs. After finding Matty's body and giving him a hunter's funeral, Dean considers recruiting Jessy and Cesar to help fight Amara; however he backs off when the two say they want to give up hunting and just live happily as a couple. The Winchesters let them have their peace.. . 20 \"Don't Call Me Shurley\". A homeless Metatron scrounges through the garbage for food before being transported to a bar where he meets the author Chuck Shurley. Initially dismissive, Metatron is stunned when Chuck reveals he is God. He wants Metatron to help in editing his autobiography and prefers to be known as Chuck. Meanwhile,the Winchesters investigate a murder-suicide and soon learn it is a stronger version of the infection fog that is making the townspeople go mad. Chuck reveals he's been traveling the world and only wants to talk about things he's done as a human. Metatron's criticism of Chuck's writing gets him to reveal he has some sympathy for Lucifer turning into a villain because of the Mark of Cain and the burden of containing Amara. He likes the Winchesters and constantly brought back Castiel for them, but their quest to destroy the Mark is what freed Amara, so he is done helping them. Since God is Being while Amara is Nothingness, Chuck became lonely and thought by creating things he could convince Amara to be better, but she just destroyed everything. After barely locking her away and seeing all the conflict both humans and angels create, Chuck walked away, letting them sort it out for themselves and sees no point in fighting Amara again. Metatron is disgusted that Chuck has become a coward. Chuck is briefly enraged but goes back to writing. As Sam is infected with the fog, Dean is unaffected holds onto him and yells for Amara to stop this. Chuck sings one song at the bar as a shocked Metatron reads the final pages of the autobiography. The fog and infections disappear and all the townspeople, including those who were killed, are restored to life. Dean finds his old amulet in Sam's pocket, glowing and they follow it to the middle of the street where it leads the Winchesters to Chuck", "timestamp": 1511049600, "rating": 5.0, "sentiment": 0.0450291462505748, "overall": 7.612572865626436, "wordCount": 1336, "customer": {"customerId": "ATSFS4004URM7", "name": "Jim Phillips", "cluster": 0}, "product": {"asin": "B015WVHV4E", "title": "Supernatural: Season 11", "brand": "Jared Padalecki", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61fTRHcBo4L.jpg", "price": 29.99, "categories": ["Boxed Sets", "Television"], "avgRating": 4.82247191011236, "avgSentiment": 0.461051354925932, "avgOverall": 8.47510029742719, "reviewCount": 445}}, {"summary": "An Endurance Match for the Soul", "review": "I don't know why I feel compelled to write about this film.  Im not a reviewer, I generally consider myself more of a passive fan of films than a cinephile, and there are already plenty of reviews of this six year old film.. . Like many people in the western world, Id heard of A Serbian Film due to its notoriety over  well, over baby rape and necrophilia.  If you don't already know the synopsis, the movie is about a retired actor (Milos) that agrees to do an art film for an exorbitant amount of money.  When things get weird (an understatement considering the nature of this movie) he quits the film only to suddenly wake up the next morning with a gun in his hand, numerous injuries, and no sign of his wife and son.  As he tries to piece together what happened, he finds video tapes that show that he was drugged and made to take part in some horrific acts.. . While I am a fan of horror, I like my horror films to be along the lines of supernatural or existential.  I like playful films like The Conjuring and Poltergeist, I like horror films with a deeper meaning and social commentary like the Living Dead series and They Live, and of course Im a fan of art films like Eraserhead and Nekromantik.  In spite of the numerous cute names out there for films like Hostel and The Human Centipede, Im generally not into torture porn or gornography.  Genre conventions are always hard to apply in many cases and as such, I do make exceptions to this in the name of a good story:  Ichi the Killer, The Midnight Meat Train, and the first Saw come to mind.  Call me a chicken, but in general I just don't have the stomach for over the top violence.  The problem is that I love movies to the point where when Im watching them, I get so immersed in them that it feels real to me.  When Im watching Aliens, even though Ive seen it a hundred times, I always root for Ripley when she takes the first real offensive against the xenomorph beast.  I fall to pieces everytime I see The Fountain and watch Izzi die all over again.  I always wish I were inside David Lynchs head when I watch Eraserhead.  Yes, I even giggle like a child when I watch Finding Nemo because Im right there swimming next to Dory.  Sadly, this is probably why I rarely find a movie that I don't like at all, and realistic gory violence is just hard for me to sit through.  When I watch Poltergeist, as dear as that movie is to my heart (thank you mom for making that the first movie I ever saw), that may as well be my face that Martin Casella is peeling off in the mirror.. . So why the interest in A Serbian Film?  Well first off, I was curious.  Not curious enough to shell out the $30 it cost for an uncut DVD intentionally made to look like a bootleg back in 2010 (you don't want to know how much that version is worth now), but still curious.  Second off, this is a landmark film of sorts.  Its one that pushes the boundaries of filmmaking in the same way that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre did in its time.  I saw Cannibal Holocaust for the same reason.  Mind you, I regret watching that one because the scene with the turtle was taking things way too far, but at least I can say I saw it.  I have High Tension in my DVD rack (Ive yet to manage the courage to watch it mind you) because it kicked off the current wave of French Extremism the same way Ichi the Killer started a flood of violent films in Japan.  A Serbian Film is the same way in a sense.  Many movies in the past have touched on necrophilia and child sex, but never has one come about thats as brutal as this was reputed to be.  Not many films get banned these days (weve become numb to the violence!), so one that manages to get banned in nine countries in the 21st century must really be setting a new standard.. . There is another reason I wanted to see it, though:  Artistic merit.  In spite of the notoriety it was getting for its content, director Sran Spasojevi has asserted that at its core, its a critique of the Serbian government (hence the name seemingly having nothing to do with what the reputed nature of the film is.)  From an interview with Spasojevic, This is a diary of our own molestation by the Serbian government... It's about the monolithic power of leaders who hypnotize you to do things you don't want to do. You have to feel the violence to know what it's about.\"  Hes gone on to add further explanation to this stating that Serbian cinema has no rules (judging by this movie, not even rules of decency), but the bulk of funding comes from the government and as such, films tend to reflect what the government wants the world to see.  I say the world because in the case of Serbian cinema, they're marketing it toward western audiences.  Most of the world knows Serbia for one thing:  Conflict.  Many Serbian films have an eye toward the emotional and psychological horrors of war and the ensuing poverty.  So at its heart, A Serbian Film is supposed to be a movie with a political agenda, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in horror.  Night of the Living Dead is a classic film not just for kickstarting the zombie craze, but because the core of the movie was a statement on race relations in the 60s.  George Romero has always made a point of incorporating social commentary into the Dead movies; Dawn of the Dead was a parody of consumerism, Day of the Dead was a criticism of military being autonomous from the governments they worked on behalf of, Land of the Dead was a satire on American lifestyles, and so on.  Its the same reason Im a sucker for Disney films:  I like messages encouraging positive change disguised as mindless entertainment (Im looking at you, Inside Out!). . So enough about the premise of the film, what about the film itself, right?  Ill start with the superficial stuff first:  The soundtrack was EXCELLENT!!!  Its electronic oriented, but not in the way that Junkie XL fluffed and filled out the background (in a good way) for Mad Max: Fury Road or Mark Isham abused pop-techno for Blade.  I imagine in 2010 this was very cutting edge music and even now as I listen to it in the background, its beautiful.  It mixes then-current mellow dubstep (think less brostep like Skrillex and more of the original funky and soothing DUBstep like Benga and Distance) and the earliest roots of trap.  Its a brilliant technique not often seen in movies.  There are a few moments in this movie that establish tone and ambiance (car rides, walks through abandoned buildings, etc.) and rather than let some ambient piece play in the background, they have this hard but slow groove pounding out in the background while this HUGE razorsharp synth reaches out and cuts you.  Its hard to explain properly but trust me, in context, its a wonderful effect and really sets the tone of the movie.  (For a great excerpt of the soundtrack, check out Pazi Sta Radis by Sky Wikluh).  Its heavy as hell, but its so foreboding.  The director took a risk in using a soundtrack like this, but it really pays off in the same way that the music for Wrong Cops almost becomes its own character in the movie.  My all time favorite movie soundtrack is Cliff Martinezs orchestra-gone-electronic score for the Solaris remake (completely off topic here, but to this day Im amazed that there were no electronic instruments used in that soundtrack because the instruments were played in nontraditional ways that made them sound otherworldly), but Id have to say this is easily one of my top ten movie soundtracks.  The fact that there wasn't an official soundtrack released makes me sad.. . Cinematography?  As dumb luck would have it, I recently stumbled on an interesting article about movie color palettes, so thats fresh on the mind.  In short, color palettes help to establish the tone of a movie in much the same way that a cohesive color set makes artwork become more emotional.  The colors in this movie are stark.  Its like somebody cranked up the contrast, but in a good way.  For the horror scenes, the dark colors are deep shades of black and the whites often integrate hints of brown and red.  When the characters are out in the real world and away from the filth, it integrates bright blues and rich shades of orange.  The camera work is really well done.  One scene that particularly stands out is when they start filming the principal photography of the art film.  Milos is in this hallway with a cameraman on either side of him.  The audience is positioned perfectly in the center at the end of this hallway.  Milos is staring directly at the audience, the cameraman to his left is facing the audience as well (recording what Milos sees) and the cameraman to his right is following Miloss movements at a perfect ninety degree angle.  To me this conveyed a sense that the people behind the art film were professionals in a way that no dialog could have demonstrated.  You know from watching their perfect synchronization that they had done this before.  The cameramen being in black with sunglasses conveyed a coldness to them as if the synchronization were mechanical.  That moment made me afraid for Milos.  If these men turned on him, they would be unstoppable machines.  The horror scenes were very well shot.  Without painting too graphic a picture, I can say that there was a reason why the film was investigated by the Serbian government.  The cuts and the placing of the camera made things look uncomfortably realistic and two moments in particular made me have to pause and reassure myself that its just a movie.. . And of course just to get it out of the way, theres the plot.  In case you didn't already figure it out, its graphic as hell.  If you really wanted to see this movie, you probably did six years ago, but if you didnt, its available on Wikipedia if you must read it.. . So before I move on to the real meat of what Im trying to write, Id like to touch on the acting.  Its hard to judge an actors ability when they're speaking a language thats different from your own native tongue, so you don't know if they're voicing their inflections properly.  A film like this, a lot of the acting is done less through dialogue and more through expression.  The look on Miloss face as he watches the tapes seems authentic, the victims seem full of genuine horror, the director is believably mad, and Miloss son was convincing in his post-experience catatonia.  Honestly, I hope the kid that acted that part is okay after making a film like this because I really believed in his performance.. . So now you know all the technical details of the film.  The soundtrack is engaging, the cinematography is beautiful and clever even during the most relentlessly brutal scenes, the plot is  well, it is what it is, and the acting is worrisomely authentic.  What about the content?  What about the message?  In all honesty, Im still a bit on the fence about it.  As a shock piece, it succeeds most certainly.  Though many movies have scared me, this is one of only two I can think of that I had to take a break from because the violence was hard to handle.  The baby rape scene and the decapitation necrophilia both made me pause.  The camera angles, the cuts, and those god awful sound effects (Id really prefer to not go into this any further because the visual is already shocking enough) were convincing and really makes me wish I could unsee them in the same way I wish I hadnt subjected myself to the tortoise scene in Cannibal Holocaust.. . There has always been a line between art and shock.  Its a hard line to pin down and lord knows people have been trying since the very beginnings of cinematic history.  Is They Live a legitimate jab at consumerism or is it just a fun Friday film?  Is Pink Flamingos an exhibition of artistic style or is it just grotesque pornography?  Is Pulp Fiction a social commentary or  just an excuse to be vulgar?  While I watched A Serbian Film, I couldn't help but think back to Jrg Buttgereits Nekromantik.  Admittedly, I hunted down and watched Nekromantik at a time in my life where I was after something truly stomach-churning and a movie about necrophilia seemed like it would fit the bill.  But I was rewarded with something that was far from just a strictly shocking movie.  Without being told to look for it, I found Nekromantik to be a fascinating look at subjects such as existentialism, sexuality, isolation, and even ironically, the desensitization of cinema audiences.  It took scenes of gore and transposed them to a different field where the protagonists girlfriends relationship with a corpse was a reflection of the protagonists own inability to cope with intimacy and dream sequences of a dead rabbit were indicative of the liberation from mortal toils that comes with death.  This movie that I sought strictly for its controversy acted as a lens that allowed me to better see the nature of life itself.  But what about A Serbian Film?  What of the message?  I feel that A Serbian Film is the opposite of Nekromantik.  Whereas with Nekromantik I wasn't looking for meaning but found it anyway, with A Serbian Film I was searching for meaning and honestly its kinda hard to find.  If I hadnt been told that A Serbian Film was a commentary on life in Serbia, I would have never known.. . So knowing in advance what to expect as far as meaning and being on the lookout for it, there were traces of it.  Its harder to spot as an outsider to their culture, but there are certain a-ha! moments.  This portion assumes youve already seen the movie, but heres a blow-by-blow of moments I thought were meant to be symbolic.  I feel the fact that Miloss brother was a police officer was important in this role.  Its a little blatant, but in this case, the brothers actions represented a raping of the people.  The government sees something that the people have, and it devises ways to take them.  I feel that most of the raping needs no explanation as we Americans love to use rape analogies when it comes to paying our taxes.  From the newly birthed to the recently deceased, were all raped by the government.  The costar that has her teeth pulled and is raped literally to death could be symbolic of how those that stand up against injustice are themselves attacked.  Most of the dialogue in the movie is about staging events to come, but a lot happens toward the end of the film as far as verbiage that could be interpreted in more than one way.  For instance, when its revealed that Miloss brother is raping Miloss wife while Milos is raping his son (I think Im setting a world record here for how many times a tense of the word rape has been used in a document), the brother comments that Now, were a true Serbian family.  The timing and phrasing of it means more than just the perverse sense of closeness.  The government has taken what its wanted and in the course of its actions, has made Milos, the common citizen, take whats important from his own family to the point where the son is psychologically catatonic for the rest of the movie.  It could be emblematic of soldiers being made to go to war and fight against their own.  It could also mean that the economic ravages caused by the government forced his family to suffer.  I feel that as far as a message is concerned, the real star of the movie is the director.  The director is always pulling strings, whispering in Milos ear, telling him and his crew what to do, and when he dies, hes replaced by another that will carry out his original plan.  I like to think that maybe the director was Slobodan Milosevic, former Head of State of Serbia.  He rose to power and brought his nation to conflict with numerous nations including Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Yugoslavia, and Slovenia.  When he went away, he was replaced by a new director that continued the same mission, leading to the conflict that caused Kosovo to declare independence.  Alternatively, the director could just be the government behind Serbias film industry.  Before he died, his last words were your actions are worthy of a film.  This could be interpreted as Well, now that we have a battle scene and some sympathy for the audience, the government will fund this film or it could be more in line with my original theory in that now that youve proven you can fight, you should become a soldier and fight for Serbia.  The nurse with the drugs I think is the Serbian film industry.  She exists to provide the people with something that makes them horny and angry.  (I hereby declare the official term to be hangry.  Wait, thats already taken)  She injects people with her harmful product at the discretion of the director (government) and in the end, suffers and slowly dies because of it (the bloody pipe she masturbated herself with) while everybody watches.  Im also seeing meaning in the thugs that beat up Milos in the street.  The thugs were harassing some poor beautiful woman (another country?) and rather than intervene, the Serbian people (Milos) sat there and masturbated to it until the thugs beat up Milos.  When the film crew arrived (the Serbian government) they quickly dispatched the thugs, were about to rape Milos, but they let the woman go.  It wasn't something they forgot in the movie either, they blatantly showed the woman walking away from the scene.  This is deliberate and intentional as the film crew made no move to stop her.  If it had been any other gorno film, she would have been killed too and probably raped.  Its hard to say what this could mean exactly as Serbian political affairs are not something I know much about outside of a casual glance at Wikipedia, but perhaps she was Kosovo i.e. the potential part of the nation that got away?  And the scene where the grandmother offers up the granddaughter after her own daughter was murdered?  The way it was so staged and artificial gives the impression of government manipulation i.e. Well, youve killed my daughter, you want my granddaughter, too?  But also, later in the film, the young girl is found out in the neighborhood unhurt.  The government was willing to rape everything from infants to the dead, but they left the girl alone.  Not only did they not rape her in the end, but she was even specifically shown as the only real survivor of this whole movie.  Why?  Thats a question Im going to have to ponder should I ever decide to torment myself by being reminded of the existence of this film.. . So is A Serbian Film an important political message or just a simple splatter film?  Its hard to say.  This movie plays jump rope with the line.  It shocks the hell out of the viewer with imagery that the audience never could have imagined wanting to see.  Though the message does feel intentional, it was very deeply buried in the same way that The Matrix is supposedly an analysis of the dichotomy of human choice. (Yeah right, its a timeless action flick with no inherent meaning or moral lesson.)  The examples above are relatively few compared to the overall movie.  Take for instance the penis hostage scene.  (How often does one get the opportunity to type out that phrase, right?)  I cant think of a possible reason for its existence other than to propel the movie into the next scene where the thugs beat Milos for masturbating in the street.  Why does it matter?  Because I think if this film was truly designed with a political agenda in mind, they would have found a way to make such a climactic event into another statement.  Sure small things could be forgiven for the sake of moving the story along, but something so pivotal as an escape and so deliberate as penis hostage?  It leads me to think that the writers decided that a political agenda was necessary not as the cause of the story, but rather as a supplement, an excuse or a scapegoat.  Yes, were really pushing it with this film, but were sending a message!. . All in all, take what you will from it, the bottom line is that this movie is grotesque.  Movies like Nekromantik that deal with lurid subject matter handle it very tastefully.  One thing I am thankful for in this is that I sometimes worry that the internet has made me a soulless monster.  The fact that I had to stop A Serbian Film at the baby rape scene let me know that theres still something humane in there.  Other than that, this movie is very hard to stomach.  Its repulsive on so many levels.  There may be a message to it, but it may not be worth the psychological battering you're likely to take in watching it.  So the questions remain unanswered:  Is this film important?  Only time will tell as its only been six years since its release.  Maybe this somehow influenced the French extreme movies in the same way that this movie was evidently influenced by Italian splatter and giallo films.  (Seriously, what the hell is going on in Europe to make you guys churn out this stuff?)  It certainly didn't have an effect on Serbian politics nor the worlds view of them.. . Is it a good movie, though?  Id have to say that it is.  Its well made on so many fronts.  I love the soundtrack to pieces, the cinematography conveyed so much, the actors were flawless at their jobs, and I felt in the moment the whole way through.  It sucked me in and made me personally experience horrors that Im fully prepared to never experience again.. . And now the big one:  Can I recommend this movie?  This is a question Ive asked myself through the course of all this bantering.  Is this a movie I could for instance take to my mom and tell her You should watch this.  Its very graphic, but the underlying message makes it worth the experience?  I can justify most things in the name of art.  I think Pisschrist is a profound piece of artwork, I admire the man that painted the Virgin Mary in elephant dung for knowing that it was an honorable and sacred piece that would ultimately be considered controversial, I think Banksy is a transgressive genius, and I will probably end up defending Shia LaBeoufs artistic leanings with my dying breath.  Recently someone posted online about how some glasses were left on the floor at an art gallery and the people at the exhibit thought it was art.  I would have probably been one of those people staring at the glasses wondering at their meaning.  Art is a broad topic, but for each person, the definition of art has those lines.  So would I recommend to my mother that she watch A Serbian Film?  I cant.  Its well made, but the premise that it could be in any way artistically, politically, or socially relevant eludes me.  This is not art, its ultimately very well produced shlock trying to pass itself as a message.  I cant say that Im going to take any long-lasting meaning or insight from this experience.  I will however probably need therapy to erase the sounds of a baby being raped from my head.  Now if youll excuse me, Im going to go wash my mouth out with beer and watch some Disney!", "timestamp": 1464307200, "rating": 4.0, "sentiment": 0.0788730468221084, "overall": 6.697182617055271, "wordCount": 1214, "customer": {"customerId": "ADDPO0SDRJ7A7", "name": "Jim Wicked", "cluster": 1}, "product": {"asin": "B0042L0P1C", "title": "A Serbian Film (2010) ( Srpski film ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]", "brand": null, "imageUrl": null, "price": 19.99, "categories": ["Movies"], "avgRating": 3.538258575197889, "avgSentiment": 0.0161698387520296, "avgOverall": 6.078683172077964, "reviewCount": 379}}, {"summary": "\"PERFECT: Android Rising\" (Chris R. Notarile, 2013) Review", "review": "The questions that Artificial Intelligence brings about are as potent today as they were in the days of Karel apek and William Gibson. Does artificial intelligence, in essence, equate to being alive? Could artificial intelligence lead to artificial emotion or artificial ideology? If artificial intelligence is severed, is it considered murder any more so as abortion?.  Were it to grow exponentially through education as human intelligence does, could it become so self-aware that it turns against us with deadly force in the name of its own superiority?.  These questions, along with fertile narrative, scientific and visual potential, paint a tempting backdrop for those choosing to venture into the realms of Science Fiction..   Just ask Chris R. Notarile..   His 2013 film Perfect: Android Rising (retitled \"Battledroid\" here) is the independent writer/directors third feature film and it proudly shows. Hes learning, consistentlyand thats a good thing..  Following an extended prologue set a decade prior, the year is 2059. Retcon Labs Chief of Staff Dr. Peter Hess (Roberto Lombardi) has been called forth to create a solution to the problem of rebel resistance fighters (Kasey Williams, Hector De La Rosa and Dana Jesberger) who have chosen to wage urban warfare against the Republic of America, which has replaced the former democracy of our nation with a vicious near-dictatorship made dangerous by manipulated perceptions (more on that later)..  His answer is built in the form of LIA (Samantha Talbott), a self-sufficient android warrior capable of wiping out the resistance. Under the command of General Arken (Rick Zahn), shes sent in to neutralize the rebel threat and maintain the Republics interests of absolute domination..  But when an unexpected circumstance severs LIAs programming, the resistance embarks on a race against time to learn more about her operations in an effort to gain an advantage and finally turn the tides of war in their favor..  Perfect: Android Rising is a mindful cautionary tale under disguise as a brisk, efficient tech-savvy actioner, as is the case with most suitable Science Fiction. The action scenes move with momentum, the cast makes the film even more memorable than it might have been without these specific actors and the writing is among the most solid Notarile has provided to date save for his incredible work on the short-lived and notoriously dismantled Deadpool web series..  One of the more peculiar and fascinating elements of the film is that it portrays a unique dystopian future where civilization has not been compromised as a result of cybernetic progress. Androids may be more prevalent, but humans are still flipping the switches and pulling the strings of the world..   Puppet Masters and the games they play..  This brings about the films central themes of control and individuality amidst a world of conformity and suppression..  Obviously we have the concept in its broadest example with LIA being put under the control of her government handlers, monitoring her from a distance like flesh and bone Gods unwilling to put blood on their own hands..  The lines between good and evil are skewed as the road the film travels is one paved with noble intentions that yield varying results. Hess is not a purely malicious individual, demonstrated by the heart it takes to create LIA in his wifes image. The Tracker is merely a follower of orders. Even the team of resistance fighters eventually breaks the barriers of protagonist and antagonist as every main character winds up shedding the conventional labels of good and evil to become the same thing..  Human..  LIA undergoes this character arc in the literal sense. But in their own way, every other character follows suit. They abandon the titles that genre fiction would bequeath them and come out at the end as human beings. No more, no less..  And as humans, we don't concern ourselves with such designations. We don't go forth in the world to purposefully commit evil or lead by the example of good. There are no Heroes and Villains. There are only our own individual intentions, our own personal agendasthe results and consequences of which we can neither foresee nor control. It is those results that determine and designate good and evil in hindsight and retrospect. Hess work is done so with the hope of putting an end to war, never bothering to consider the impact his choices can make..  Remember this night the next time you play God..  While his creations commit atrocity, should he be held responsible if his agenda was altruistic in the first place? To create LIA to bear the resemblance of his wife says what about his character? That despite what monetary or professional gains he could make in the concept of building a piece of equipment for military use, theres a crucial piece of him that made this decision from more intimate, vulnerable place..  LIA couldve looked like anyone. But he chose her for a reason. And that reason is a sympathetic one..  How could he be so evil then if he behaves this way psychologically, clinging onto his love the only way he knows how?.  The moment that supports this is the end of the film itself, where LIA questions Hess about this very idea..  For all his tech-based bravado in presenting LIA to the President earlier, Hess is reduced to a primal humanalmost an infant in his dependency. His last words, quite poetically, are I don't understand..  Hess has transformed into the personification of man. And in this future world, where technology has grown exponential and sentient, transference has occurred. Machine has become the parental authority and Man has become the simpleton child..  All LIA can do with this newfound authority is embrace and comfort Man in assurance..  On the flip side, it can be equally argued that another thematic thread depicted here is the idea that even in a world populated with machines made in mans image, man itself might be the most dangerous machine of all. This idea is clearly portrayed by the character of the films one true villain, General Arken..  While human personality comes with the territory of the grizzled combat vet, Arkens exchanges and goals through the film are nearly robotic in their own perverted way. He sees LIA not as a potential vessel for enlightenment or understanding but as another soldier..  Human soldiers are the Androids of our age. Theyre dressed to type, packed into sardine cans and shot off to the thick of a hell we cant imagine, all so they can pile on top of one another as corpses dropped in the name of freedom and providence. Were it up to Arken, hed be more than happy to have an assembly line of LIAS, fully functional and fully disposable, like a constant unstoppable typhoon that wouldnt give until the enemy was eradicated..  By the end, hes more of a robot than LIA, barking orders as if hes reading from a scriptor, more accurately, as if HE were the one downloaded with commands to follow blindly..  The technical constructs of the film are handled with a delicate but firm hand, tempered by experience while simultaneously mastered through circumstance. The definition of a low (meaning no) budget filmmaker, Notarile has refined guerrilla filmmaking down to a veritable science that works for the kind of stories hes most interested in telling. His work is quick and dirty, getting the job done with just the right touch of panache and attitude, particularly in his writing..  Theres a snap to his dialogue that a lot of independent, amateur or web-based filmmakers don't quite seem to nail. Even if a given story might take turns towards the predictable or contrived, Notarile masks that effectively with a rhythm and tempo in the dialogue that seems to stem from his roots as a Jersey boy raised in the high-octane pace of both Jersey and New York. Theres a definite punchy, impatient, bad mofo attitude that flows through those burgs and Notarile keeps his finger on the pulse effortlessly..  Notarile also plays around with some tongue-in-cheek jabs at contemporary society (a blink-and-youll-miss-it headline declares a lead in the murder of infamously ridiculed Twilight actress Kristen Stewart) and criticisms of current American Science Fiction films (most notably Avatar)..  Given the morally ambiguous state of the films landscape, the cinematography of Perfect is virtually white-washed into neutral tones. Vibrancy of color is abandoned, giving way to a visual cue of the neutrality populating the narrative. Nothing is black and white but grey and uncertain. The camera is also used to great effect. Knowing his proficiency for handheld realism, Notarile fits right at home amongst the rubble of his future world, giving the film a power and kineticism that it benefits from. At some point, given more money or more time or (most likely) both, it would be nice to see Chris change things up somewhere and rise to the challenge of operating stabilizing equipment. In the go, go, go style of guerrilla, I get that its not practical. Nevertheless, I yearn for the day when Notariles eye gets to play around in the sandbox with Dolly tracks and Crane Arms..  The visual effects are a step up from earlier efforts like the short film Android, which, funny enough, is revisited and expanded upon as part of the films opening with the earlier Genesis model android (portrayed with cool calculation by the director himself). Standouts include the polarity force field surrounding Genesis during his incarceration. The depth of field with the flowing particles is spectacular and the combination of effects and lighting nails the visual tone of that scene and what it represents with the actual discussion between Genesis and Dr. Cole. There are also a great number of blood gags and splatters that are very graphic novel in nature and immensely effective as a result..  The films score, composed by Elliot Butay, is some of the best orchestral material in a work of Notariles. I especially enjoyed the tempered synthetic strings of the main titles and the various balances between somber orchestral movements and synthesized tech-beats, acting as a musical counterpoint to the conflict in the film..  The cast is a pantheon of Blinky Productions alumni, some of which Ive come to know as friends and acquaintances via social media..  What can I really say about Roberto Lombardi? When he nails it, he nails it and the best part is that he always does. To date I think Hess is the most developed character Notarile has written for him and he runs with the material, taking it to a place of relatable humanity and genuine depth. The flashback scene between he and Samantha that sets up their relationship in playing chess feels authentically natural. Couple that with the double-take realization that he was daydreaming while now playing chess with LIA, a great transition narratively, and it illustrates a real man rather than a genre stereotype of the eccentric doctor. Lombardi makes it more than that, more than what a lesser actor wouldve done. Hes given top billing by the End Credits and for good reason..  The 2nd standout for me was easily Rick Zahn as General Arken. Beyond the Kubrick fanboying of hearing someone utter the phrase in the shit (first heard by my ears in 1987s Full Metal Jacket), Zahn has personality to spare as the General. He plays more to type but, as I said, his character needed to in order to fulfill that thematic intent. Between Notariles dialogue for the character and Zahns no-nonsense delivery of it, the character is made quite memorable, even more so than I anticipated..  The remainder of the cast is all strong, so don't misunderstand that Im singling out those two first. They just happened to be my favorite performances and the performances more than speak for themselves..  Samantha accomplishes quite a task in portraying LIA primarily (her personality shines as Hess wife and again, that flashback scene really shows how natural and light hearted she can be, which goes a long way). From Lance Henriksen to Peter Weller to Schwarzenegger himself, weve seen cyborg characters before. What Samantha brings to it, I think, is an effortless grace. Shes not overtly feminine as a robot and yet theres a tenderness there that makes her interesting to look at and follow, to see what she may or may not do..  The other female leads are quite formidable with Kasey Williams as Cass and Dana Jesberger as Avis. Williams definitely brings her inner Linda Hamilton to the party (Notarile has a tendency to do that with his strong female characters doesnt he?) and she definitely has the edge necessary to give Cass the authority she needs as a character. Avis is played with a real street-urchin vibe and Jesberger works well in bringing that social angle to the urban backdrop..  Both Shawn Parr and Hector De La Rosa bring the testosterone levels to the party with gusto, having a ball as bonafide action stars in their own right. Both men could easily lead in action vehicles (as Notarile has already demonstrated with Parr as the Punisher and De La Rosa as Snake Plissken in earlier fan-made pieces). They each have a gravitas and presence thats unmistakable. Where Parr plays well in the stealthy, silent bringer of death angle, De La Rosa is a grassroots everyman. Both the roles of the Tracker and Brooks respectively make great strides in fulfilling these duties..  I also really enjoyed the quirky personality of both Nick Grock as goofy, easy going yet savvy Wyatt and Andrew Roth as bumbling, neurotic programmer Jensen. Notariles response to Im a Mac (Wyatt) and Im a PC (Jensen) perhaps? Certainly could be seen that way..  All in all, Perfect: Android Rising is a seminal work for Chris and the gang. They really pulled out all the stops even more so than on either Methodic or Stand Off and, to date, this is easily my favorite feature of theirs..  If this is an indication of the trajectory these talented filmmakers, artists and actors are moving along, then I think the best is even yet to come. Blinky Productions supporters are in for something tremendously well-crafted here and that can only mean that the future of Notariles work, unlike the one depicted here, is looking quite bright indeed.", "timestamp": 1416700800, "rating": 3.0, "sentiment": 0.1647333465560558, "overall": 5.911833366390139, "wordCount": 1003, "customer": {"customerId": "A3J883BGTTEG88", "name": "Chas Blankenship", "cluster": 0}, "product": {"asin": "B00PCSVMCK", "title": "Battledroid", "brand": "Samantha Talbott", "imageUrl": null, "price": 9.49, "categories": ["Independently Distributed", "Action & Adventure"], "avgRating": 3.2777777777777777, "avgSentiment": 0.1425493892379164, "avgOverall": 6.134151250872569, "reviewCount": 18}}, {"summary": "Hail The Emperor And Empress Of Bollywood!", "review": "To any customers reading this, MAKE SURE YOU READ THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION! Make sure you buy THIS three-disk set, because it is NOT pirated or illegal! The quality is exceptional and you won't regret it.. . First things first, FORGET ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT BOLLYWOOD! It no longer applies.. . There's only one person ultimately responsible for this exquisite experience. Ashutosh Gowariker is one of the greatest filmmakers ever. He's creates images on film that are heartbreakingly beautiful, combines them with master storytelling, and coaxes performances from the cast that defies all expectations. I have a goal to see every film he's made thus far, and the three I've seen I'd recommend to anyone! There isn't a single detail of this film he to chance, and the result is as close to perfection as a human can get. Each frame of the movie is so gorgeous you want them to be oil paintings to hang in your house. More on that when I deal with the special features.... . This movie caused a huge ruckus when it opened because of historical controversy. Being a history buff, I did some research (yes I'm weird) and while the movie did take some liberties, and leaves many things out, it gets more right than it does wrong! Besides, if it had been 100% accurate and included *everything* it would have been a nine hour movie, and would've gotten a little depressing! Movies are meant to entertain, so keep an open mind. Brushing mundane reality aside, let's focus on the world Ashutosh Gowariker so generously gave us. I can't think of many movies that look and sound as beautiful as this one is. The sets, locations, the costumes, the music, the sounds of the swords clashing, the horses, the elephants, the jewelry!!!! (I'm a girly-girl when it comes to the pretties) the food... Even if you watch this movie on mute, it's an experience, but in the name of anything sacred DON'T DO THAT!. . The music is transforming! I'm not exaggerating, when I hear the first strains of \"Jashn-E-Bahaara\" anything negative in my life disappears. I'm serious it's the best painkiller I know of. I would dance to  \"Azeem-O-Shaan Shahenshah\" all day if I could do it. More on that song later... There are two songs that I would call hymns \"Khwaja Mere Khwaja\" (Islamic) and \"Mann Mohana\" (Hindu) but as I'm neither Hindu nor Muslim, I hope I haven't offended anyone. Regardless of how to classify them the music is exquisite and the lyrics really highlight Akbar's devotion to his faith, and Jodhaa's integrity and devotion to hers. A little fun trivia for you is that,  Haidar Ali (the writer) has a cameo of a Sufi who leads his group in singing \"Khwaja Mere Khwaja\" after the Islamic wedding ceremony.  For sheer passion and the rapture of *finally* being in the arms of your love, you simply cannot top \"In Lamhon Ke Daaman Mein\" its honeymoon music to the tenth power!. . Again, check your assumptions about Bollywood song and dance at the door. Here the actors do very little singing, (okay they're dubbed who cares!) Jodhaa sings to pray, and has a verse in the \"honeymoon song\" in which she does a pretty twirl. Jalal has a pretty little verse of poetry he sings in Urdu in the \"honeymoon song\" as for dancing, he also has a pretty twirl in \"Khwaja Mere Khwaja\" but that's it! Azeem-O-Shaan Shahensha is an epic dance number with one thousand people, that would make Bugsby Berkley go green with envy, but unlike most epic numbers in Bollywood, it does not take the form of a music video! Unlike with his masterpiece \"Swades\" Mr. Gowariker doesn't heed the typical sensibilities for using music to tell the love story; it's a masterstroke keeping everything in proper historical context, and preventing the actors from breaking character.. . The background score is also beautiful and varied. The only thing that stops it from being the absolute best score I've ever heard is merely a few notes that play whenever some fool gets Jalal angry, I mean come on Mr. Roshan's eyes take care of that entirely on their own!. . Horses and doves, parrots and bunnies, camels and elephants OH MY! The gang's all here and it's great! Out with the old theater adage \"Never work with children or animals\" without them this movie would feel flat! Whether it's Jodhaa cooing with doves, bunnies, and setting her parrots free, or Jalal riding his white horse into battle, and blowing off the stress of being Shahensha (Emperor) by taming a wild elephant, you will be awed with it all and wonder, \"How in the world did they keep it all under control?\". . A caution to parents... Dear responsible, loving parents, Most of the elephants in this movie are used during battle scenes, and a few crush some soldiers even stepping on their heads. Now, I personally believe that most kids over the age of five see worse on most previews and commercials here in the USA, but I strongly urge you to view the scenes first before sitting down with the munchkins. When my nephews visit, I skip them entirely. Your's Respectfully Warpgirl.. . The costume designer Neeta Lulla and jewelers Tanishq turn everyone into people who inhabit a time and a place of lost grandeur. Okay, you might have seen Ms. Rai-Bachchan with a similar look in some of her big period films but I doubt it. I'll let you know when I see them for myself. I am certain you've *never* seen Mr. Roshan draped in silk, and brocade dripping with diamonds, pearls, rubies and emeralds! They used the real deal here! Two kilograms for his gold and ruby sword alone! In case you're wondering he's pulls it off effortlessly. If this movie had been submitted for Oscar consideration it would have won a boatload, but Costumes would be a definite lock! Special kudos to the makeup department, just flawless. I find makeup to be a bit iffy with Bollywood.. . Now, performances! I did warn you this would be long... I watched the movie the first time for Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan so it's only fair I start with her. It boggles my mind that I've read in so many places where people say she can't act! If she can't act, then I must have the wrong idea of what acting is. She uses every part of herself in a role: her voice, the way she walks, the way she eats, heck even the way she sits! Jodhaa is my favorite because she's a lady in her thirties and she's playing a young woman barely twenty and not only does she pull it off, she looks twenty! I don't mean her beautiful face, I mean in her eyes and expression there's innocence and wonder that makes that time of life so special. There are no famous Bollywood histrionics in this movie. Subtle is the name of the game and you must keep most of your focus on the eyes. I recommend the first time you watch this, you read the subtitles, then watch it again and forget them! The biggest emotional impact comes from the characters eyes. Now you'll notice quickly that Ms. Rai-Bachchan is wearing brown contacts for authenticity, but it's a credit to her skill and talent that her emotions shine through like gleaming flames.. . Jodhaa is a woman of integrity, it's her defining trait. She treats others with kindness and deep respect, but never backs down about what she believes is right. Even when other people wrong her, she doesn't berate them, or try to get even. She holds herself to high standards with grace and dignity. My favorite scene that *always* makes me cry, (my mom was torments me about it) is when she says Jalal's full name for the first time. Perfection! Nevertheless, probably her most technically brilliant scene is the \"wedding night\" scene. It's jaw dropping!. . I had no idea who Hrithik Roshan was, now I can't believe it took me over two decades to discover him! For anyone who finds his \"hunky-grin\" tiring, or thinks of him as \"the dance guy\" *forget it* just forget it all. There's no grinning at all, and I didn't even know the man could dance until Dhoom2! Are there tears? Yes. However, not the typical Bollywood tears made so famous in frothy romances, or melodramas. Like with Jodhaa, subtlety is the key to Mr. Roshan's portrayal of, Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar.. . Again he's a man in his thirties playing a young man just turning twenty and he makes it work even though his body is like no twenty year old I've ever seen. He infuses Jalal with idealism, innocence, and the deep venerability of a boy struggling not only to become a man, but also to break free from expectations of the people surrounding him and become a true leader. It's an incredibly complex performance, with layer after layer of technique and emotion.. . As written, Akbar is very close to being untouchable. He's so good, so pure, intelligent, compassionate, the bravest, ect. Quite honestly, if Mr. Roshan hadn't kept him solidly on the ground, I'd think the movie is about an angel not a man. \"Akbar's angry tune\" aside, Mr. Roshan adds a hair trigger temper, and a talent for holding a grudge that keeps him refreshingly human. Every scene he does is incredible but the ones that show that he's more than just the \"dancing hunk\" are: first, \"Khwaja Mere Khwaja\" no dialogue, just the expression of how deeply he reveres his God, and the conviction of his faith. Then, \"the wedding night\" rarely are two actors so in-tune with each other. After that, \"the mother scene\" if your heart doesn't twinge, see a doctor. All men should watch \"the groveling scene\" that's how you do it! \"The patriotic scene\" shows the moment when Jalal takes complete control of his empire and his life and Roshan is statesman and Alpha Male at the same time. However, the crown jewel is the \"do you love me\" scene. It's all in the eyes.. . Both actors are brilliant in their own rights, but neither one would have given such amazing performances without the other. Every-so-often, two actors will be put in a film and something happens. The camera becomes a window and suddenly you're not watching a movie anymore. You become a peeping Tom watching two people go through a finite space in time living and everything that comes with their lives. Mr. Roshan and Ms. Rai-Bachchan have done three films together, (this is the second) and all of them are completely different, but in every one, you become a voyeur. They don't play roles with each other, they *become* them. I know I sound insane, I feel silly writing it! Just do me a favor watch, \"the sword scene\" and when *the moment* comes, (you'll know it when it happens) try not to gasp when you see the love flowing between them.. .  NO, I am NOT saying I think they had an affair! I'm saying, that they're that good! I keep hoping to read they've signed on for a dance extravaganza. It can happen!. . Not to be outdone is the fabulous supporting cast! Two women dominate this playing field of massively talented people! First up the only fully fleshed \"villain\" in the story, (more on the bad guys in a minute)... Ila Arun plays the astute Maham Anga. Talk about every young bride's worst nightmare, the possessive Mother Figure! You see Maham Anga was one of Jalal's father's concubines, and  when Jalal's mother went with her husband while they were in exile, they left their son in her care. Later on after Jalal becomes Emperor, mom goes throughout the empire helping while \"Elder Mother\" still looks after him. Now, she's basically in charge of the entire royal court and the only person Jalal will never contradict.. . To say she doesn't like the incredibly beautiful Hindu bride Jalal has picked out is an understatement. The minute I saw her on screen I cried out, \"OMG it's the Indian Mrs. Danvers!\" I suppose that means nothing to people who haven't seen or read Rebecca... Google it, if you want. To summarize, Maham Anga is extremely jealous and hates Jodhaa with a passion that boarders on the crazy. Of course, it culminates into something terrible, but it also provides two of the most romantic moments in the movie. If her own machinations aren't bad enough, she has a biological son who causes Jalal misery, so she does double-duty as a villain in this film.. . The other amazing woman in this movie is Mrs. Poonam Sinha, who plays Jalal's biological mother Empress Hamida Banu Begum. This is the mother-in-law every bride prays for! Supportive, sweet, a helping hand in a new family, and in Jodhaa's case a new world. She wants her boy happy and can see immediately Jodhaa is exactly what he needs. It's astounding how Mrs. Sinha balances the emotions of her character. She *knows* her son considers another woman to be his \"mother\" yet instead of being bitter about it, she does what she can to help him rule and make sure someone is taking care of Jodhaa when he's busy. Of course, \"the mother scene\" just makes everything better. There is one weird thing, she talks to Jodhaa a lot, but Jodhaa never says a word! I guess her eyes talk for her.. . Now bad guys and idiots... I'll be honest, the villainy is not the sharpest of swords in the armory. In a movie with so much going on you end up not caring that they're flat. First up, the spawn of Anga. Adham Khan the jealous, sadistic, amoral, older half-brother. Every family has a bad seed. Adham is an angry guy. First his dad doesn't choose him as a successor, then his mom is obsessed with the runt (the guy is taller than most people) who got it. Personally, I think if his mother had hugged him more he might not have become a traitorous, raping, thief! Don't worry parents, there is no rape in this movie. It comes out in a verbal argument. As far as brains go, he's definitely the stupidest one! Watch and see how stupid!. . Now, the family problems don't end there. Jalal also has a pretty older sister named Banu, who has a very nasty husband! Alas, Sharifuddin Hussein wants to be Shahensha too! He does have more brains than Adham, but that's no real achievement. For the most part, he plots in secret and tries to avoid getting his hands dirty until the very end. The person I feel sorry for is Banu, she actually loves the jerk! Don't ask me why, he makes it clear he doesn't return the sentiment. He gets lots of help from other idiots, the head Religious Leader of the Mughal court. This guy hates Jalal's tolerance of things not strictly Islam and the tax reform that hurts his wallet.. . The other idiot helper is Raj Sujamal Jodhaa's brother, not really a bad guy in the evil sense, but a true moron! Sujamal is a major player in the movie. He's Jodhaa's first cousin, but they were raised as siblings. She calls him Bhaisab, (older brother) he has her rahki it's all very familial, no romantic subtext at all. The problem lies in politics. Jodhaa's dad inherited the throne from his brother Sujamal's father. Now he hopes his uncle gives him a fair share when the kingdom is divided up on his death. You'll have to watch the movie but let me put it this way, he was stupid to trust Sharifuddin.. . The actor who plays Sujamal is Sonu Sood. Apparently, he's a rising star in Bollywood, but he does very little here but mope, whine, and throw temper tantrums. Out of all the negative characters, he's the weak link because he's just so wishy-washy. Who knows, maybe that's the point. His final scene was very touching.. . There is ONE tiny flaw in this movie it drives me stark raving bonkers! In the wedding scenes, Jodhaa is decked out in her bridal finery. She's wearing amazing jewelry with a large tikka that lays flat on her forehead during the ceremony, but somehow during \"Khwaja Mere Khwaja\" it changes to a \"bell\" shaped tikka that rests on top of her hairline!. . Now Special Features! On the third disk of this set, you get... Deleted scenes with subtitles! YEY! Hindi lessons courtesy of the sing-along with the songs feature. Lots of movie trailers that hint of other deleted goodies that didn't get put in, (darn!) again with subtitles. An interview with Gowariker addressing the controversy on Historical Accuracy. There's a  little commentary involving all the heavy hitters in the movie. All in English! Mr. Roshan's accent is swoon-worthy. (Okay yes I need a 12-step program or something!) Fair warning, something went wrong with the sound during Mrs. Gowariker's (also a producer) interview. It isn't the DVD itself so don't worry. It sounds like a microphone blew out. Everyone else is as clear as a bell.. . Oh remember how I said you'll want to take the images on screen and hang them up? You can! A beautiful set of large postcards also come with the DVD's. Some of the most breataking images are there for pretty pictures! I thought about using them for there intended purpose but they're just too pretty!. . Enjoy this beautiful movie!

Starting with the radically different career-altering straight melodrama of The Flower of My Secret (1995) and moving through the explosive sexuality of Live Flesh (1997), the balanced perfection of All About My Mother (1999), the metaphysical depth of Talk to Her (2002), the extraordinary narrative gymnastics of Bad Education (2004), and the deeply moving return to the social concerns of women surviving patriarchy in Volver (2006), Almodvar laid claim to being one of the very greatest (some say THE greatest) directors in contemporary cinema. Broken Embraces (Los abrazos rotos, 2009 ) is perhaps the inevitable reality check which illustrates the central truism that even great directors sometimes make bad films. The fact that his next two works (The Skin I Live In [2011] and Im So Excited! [2013]) also fail to measure up shows Almodvar to be stuck in a career rut. His films still make money (Im So Excited! is amazingly his second most profitable film after All About My Mother) and we shouldnt over-state this sense of crisis just yet, but it remains to be seen if he can regain his artistic mojo with the up-coming Julietta. My gut tells me his best films are now behind him and we will look back on the period (1995-2006) in the same way we look back at what Ingmar Bergman did in the 60s. Lets hope Almodvar has an Autumn Sonata (1978) or a Fanny and Alexander (1982) still left to give us.. . Before I go on to review an Almodvar film I would usually attempt to contextualize what he does by outlining his position as a Spanish La Movida Madilea artist commenting on post-Franco society and his preoccupation with attack (on Francoism) and celebration (of democratic freedoms) with his themes of transition and identity search playing out in three areas  in politics, in the body and in the creative artistic process. Such a contextualization seems pointless though with Broken Embraces, a film which lacks such deep resonances. It is centrally concerned with the creative artistic process, but in a non-systematic way and at the expense of everything else. As with The Law of Desire (1987) and Bad Education the main character is a film writer/director doppelgnger for Almodvar himself, but the focus is heavily self-indulgent and the film refuses to take off and connect with anything audiences can really latch onto and be moved by, either intellectually or emotionally. There is so much brilliance on display  the acting, the stunning photography, the top dollar production values, but the script jumps around so wildly with over-intricate complexity stopping us from really connecting with anything of substance. Bad Education is if anything even more fractured and complex but its highly charged sexuality, its political resonance, its impressive Chinese box narrative construction, and its autobiographical flourishes all provide the vibrant glue which brings the elements together spectacularly well. Such glue is absent here, the various elements of the film just failing to gel. The only autobiography we see comes from Almodvars own filmography (especially the circumstances surrounding the making of Dark Habits [1984] and Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown [1988]) and the failure to expand out from that makes the film curiously akin to navel-gazing. What follows contains spoilers.. . Like Bad Education the action of Broken Embraces plays out in three time frames, 2008, 1992 and 1994. In 2008 Harry Caine (Llus Homar) is a blind film writer-director working in Madrid with his agent Judit (Blanca Portillo) and her son Diego (Tamar Novas). Recuperating from a near-fatal accident with drugs while his mother is away, Diego asks Caine to tell him about the past and especially why his secretive mother is scared of the son of a rich recently deceased financier Ernesto Martel (Jos Luis Gmez) now calling himself Ray X (Rubn Ochandiano). In 1992 we see how the aging Martel hooked his beautiful young secretary Lena (Penlope Cruz). He buys her (she is also a part time prostitute working for Madame Mylene [Kiti Mnver]) by paying for her fathers cancer treatment. In 1994 Lena is now Martels live-in mistress ambitious to be an actress. She auditions for Mateo Blanco, an established film director who later becomes Harry Caine. Financed by Martel, the film is titled Girls and Suitcases (a clear spoof on Women on the Verge) and during the shoot Lena and Mateo conduct an affair under the meddling eye of Martels son officially employed to do a making of documentary, but actually there to spy on Mateo and Lena for his father. Intensely jealous, Martel finds out about the affair and physically abuses Lena. Mateo takes Lena for a month to Lanzarote, checking in to their hotel as Harry Caine. Meanwhile Martel sabotages the editing of Girls and Suitcases, having the film made from the worst takes to destroy the careers of both Mateo and Lena. Returning to Madrid with Lena, a car wreck results in her death and his blindness. Judit comes and finds Mateo is now Harry Caine for good. Back in 2008 Judit decides to tell the truth about what really happened to Girls and Suitcases  that she allowed Martel to make the ruinous changes and she told him Mateo and Lena had gone to Lanzarote. She also tells Diego that Mateo is his father. Mateo is about to blackmail Ray X for destroying the unused footage of Girls and Suitcases when Judit tells him she has kept it all having disobeyed Martels destruction order. The film finishes with Mateo re-cutting his film at the editing table alongside Judit and their son.. . Broken Embraces is centrally concerned with the fragility of vision and how impossible it is to control what we see. The films narrative spins around the key event of the car crash which kills Lena and blinds Mateo. The blindness is both emotional (the loss of his love) and physical (the loss of his eyes). This is paralleled in the script with Martel meddling with his artistic vision as captured on celluloid as he re-cuts the film in Mateos absence. Even after something is photographed, the vision remains open to manipulation. It is on this register that Broken Embraces is at its most honest and effective, rooted as it is in Almodvars own experience of having a producer meddle with his work after finishing it. In interview he explains, Years ago, on one of my films, the producer arrived with 18 details to be retouched in editing. I refused and he said I could burn the material. I threatened him because the law was on our side, and I was vehement. I resisted for months, waiting for the situation to end, until the distributer came to demand the film and it had to be released as it was. And it was a success. The film was Dark Habits and the producer Herv Hachuel had also stipulated that Almodvar feature his girlfriend Cristina Snchez Pascual, even though the director wasn't happy with her and had to change the script substantially because of limitations as he saw it in her acting. To this day Almodvar still distances himself from the film, the experience of making it rankling within him and ending up here in Broken Embraces. The rescue of Girls and Suitcases is paralleled with Mateo surging back to life together with the discovery of his new-found family. The last shot is strongly suggestive of the three of them bonding as a family unit after years of all suffering different kinds of impaired vision  guilt for Judit at having co-operated with Martel, confusion for Diego over his paternal roots and mysterious behavior of his mother, and creative oblivion for the director robbed of sight who finally sees that all films must be completed, even blindly.. . The difficult of controlling ones creative vision is also clearly laid out in the whole 1994 segment of the film which deals with the making of Girls and Suitcases. The film is obviously based on Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown with the terrorist changed to a cocaine dealer and lays out the essential battle that takes place on many films between director and producer, and how impossible it is for the director to see without making compromises, without being blinded by the producer and the commercial imperatives he carries with him. Not only does Martel make it impossible for Lena to concentrate on acting, but he pushes her down stairs breaking her leg in the process which necessitates script re-writes. He also makes his presence felt through his son Ernesto Jr. (Ray X) pointing his camera at everyone, getting in the way by making his documentary so that daddy can see what Lena and Mateo are doing. The footage shot by him is presented as a film within a film by Almodvar which acts as a constant irritation which plagues the production. This is an extension of Victoria Abrils Scarface reality TV show presenter in Kika (1992) and continues the directors attack on the Tube. The producers interference continues right into the cutting room and the director is only left free once he has died, and even then it is only because a loyal friend (Judit) has disobeyed the order to destroy all the original material. Almodvar was once linked with going to Hollywood to direct Brokeback Mountain, but at the time he turned it down saying he would never be allowed to make the film as he would want to make it. Elsewhere he has described Hollywood films as producers cinema so I guess we cant expect an American film from him any time in the future. . The restless way the film flits around (especially between 2008 and 1994) suites the central theme of the difficulty of seeing concretely and the effect is muddled even further by the relentless quotes and references to others films and directors who are clearly of great importance to Mateo/Almodvar. When Mateo is feeling down he wants to hear the voice of Jeanne Moreau (in Lift to the Scaffold [1957, Louis Malle]) and when Ernesto Jr. plagues Lena with his camera mounted on a tripod Peeping Tom (1960, Michael Powell) is cited. As Diego sorts through DVDs on Mateos shelf we hear the names of Nicholas Ray, Jules Dassin, Fritz Lang, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini and films such as 8  (1963, Fellini) and Fanny and Alexander (1982, Bergman). Watch the walls of Mateos home and studio and we can see posters of The Big Heat (1953, Lang) and Gun Crazy (1950, Joseph H. Lewis) among others. Most of these references don't mean anything except to tell us what Mateo /Almodvar value and the yardstick by which they measure themselves. The most meaningful quote (in the sense that we see Mateo and Lena watch a clip on TV) is to Voyage in Italy (1953, Roberto Rossellini). The way this is done underlines a great fault in this film as clearly the film isn't as bedded within the narrative structure as All About Eve (1951, Joseph. L. Mankiewicz) is in All About My Mother or Bellissima (1951, Luchino Visconti) is in Volver. The clip we see is the famous one of Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders at Pompeii seeing a plaster cast of a couple in a locked embrace just as they had been 2,000 years ago at the very moment the lava from Vesuvius drowned them. The Bergman character realizes the cold embrace represents her own cold marriage and turns away in tears. Almodvar clearly means to draw a parallel between the couple we see and the cold relationship Lena is locked into with Martel which Mateo is rescuing her from. Dig deeper though and we find the reference is wrong. In the Rossellini film the point is that both frozen couples had once been in love and that the realization that a living marriage has become so cold leads to a miraculous epiphany where they re-discover each other. This has nothing to do with Broken Embraces in which Lenas relationship with Martel has never been romantic at all and there is no epiphany. The reference may appeal to Almodvar as he is very eager to cite a film held up by the French New Wave as an important one in the history of cinematic modernism, but it lacks resonance of any kind for the story at hand beyond the surface reaction of Lena to cold marriage.. . Almodvar is usually so good at bedding his references within the fabric of his films and pretension is not a word I would usually use for him, but clearly in Broken Embraces there is something wrong with the relationships between the characters. All the fractured intensity of temporal jumping around, flashy film-referencing and cerebral meditation on seeing pushes simple human relationships off the screen. The film is clearly meant to be a romance with Penlope Cruz putting in what seems to be a wonderful performance as a tragic beauty used and abused by the predatory Martel, but who gets a brief respite from her suffering with her relationship with Mateo. Sadly, Almodvar never allows us to feel her emotions, her stress or her desperation. Indeed the lack of any romantic clinching scene between Lena and Mateo tells us that perhaps this director is temperamentally unsuited to romance. There is plenty of sex in all 19 Almodvar films, but preciously little romance. Take the brief sequence here where Mateo takes Lena to Lanzarote. To a wonderful Miguel Poveda love song on the soundtrack the island is introduced by a loving helicopter shot which shows off the spectacular black sand beaches to perfection. Lena and Mateo are shown together. Lena often has her arms around him, but he always has his back turned to her, preoccupied with taking photographs  of the sculpture on the road, of the beach. One scene has him photographing a landscape as Lena hugs him from behind. Is this guy so disinterested in his partner? Or is he really just a picture-taking monster, a machine to equal Ernesto Jr.? Even the would-be romantic clinch of the couple watching Voyage in Italy is accompanied by the taking of a self-timer-delayed photograph of the two of them. Perversely, Almodvar refuses to let romance ever settle and we never sense Mateo is saddened by her death either, something which proves disastrous for Cruz whose wonderful performance goes completely for nothing in a film too busy depicting Mateos problems of seeing within his own art to bother about his relationship with her. Another outstanding performance to suffer is Blanca Portillos Judit. Barely on screen for the first two thirds of the film, we are given fleeting hints that she had been in a relationship with Mateo long ago and that she is hiding something, but suddenly without warning shes given a grandstand restaurant scene in which she reveals how she cooperated with Martel to destroy Girls and Suitcases. In itself the scene is grippingly played, but we are left wondering why we couldn't have seen more of her in the film and the sudden shift of focus from Mateo to her sits very uneasily indeed. The film being firmly centered on Mateo surely it would have made better sense to feature his reaction to her words rather than focus so deeply on her face in one spectacular scene which seems to have strayed in from another film entirely. The following mornings revelation to Diego that Mateo is her father is also mismanaged. Without any build-up, our reaction is simply, So what? Like Cruz, Portillo is a marvelous actress, but again her performance has been sabotaged by a director too busy focusing on his own creative process to worry about letting his characters breathe believably. Almodvar is usually such an accomplished actor-director that it comes as a surprise that he could get the balance so wrong in this film. So much more could have been achieved with so much less self-reflexivity.. . Lovers of Almodvar will want to see this film. It does bare tall the hallmarks of a typical film coming from him  the lush Rodrigo Prieto primary color photography, Antxn Gmezs chic production designs (check out Martels sumptuous home!) and the appearance of many of the usual actors (Rossy De Palma, Lola Dueas, Chus Lampreave, ngela Molina, Mariola Fuentes, Carmen Machi, etc) are all eye-catching. Lovers of Women on the Verge will also relish re-visiting old territory. It is perhaps useful to see a less successful Almodvar if only to appreciate the other films which are so much better. Bad Education and The Law of Desire are also centrally about the artistic process, but they never for one moment ever forget about the character relationships central to the story, everything bedded within a rich texture which eludes the director here.", "timestamp": 1457395200, "rating": 3.0, "sentiment": 0.0782465136339675, "overall": 5.695616284084919, "wordCount": 1048, "customer": {"customerId": "APN2A9RHVXGTT", "name": "Film Buff", "cluster": 1}, "product": {"asin": "B002VECLXM", "title": "Broken Embraces", "brand": "Penlope Cruz", "imageUrl": null, "price": 14.97, "categories": ["Art House & International", "By Original Language", "Spanish"], "avgRating": 4.136363636363637, "avgSentiment": 0.2870684472659148, "avgOverall": 7.354034754528424, "reviewCount": 66}}, {"summary": "Much more good than bad here", "review": "It started in September of 1995 and quickly took over the WWE as the king of monday nights in the wrestling world.

The match itself isn't bad, lots of power moves from all the guys. There was some underlying tension between Sting & Luger as Lex was using some dirty tactics that Sting didn't approve of. Lex hit Animal with a weight lifting plate and covered Animal to keep the tag titles. 7/10.. . -4/29/96, Parking Lot Brawl, Belfast Bruiser vs. Lord Steven Regal: Pretty hard hitting match where these two hit each other off of cars with Bruiser even hitting Regal with a bumper and a couple of windows get shattered when Bruiser hits them.

This one is more remembered for Hall & Nash coming to ringside and security comes down to protect the WCW wrestlers, but during the chaos Luger gets rolled up by Booker T for the 3 count and Harlem Heat are the new Tag Team champions. 6/10.. . -7/8/96, The New World Order Takes Over: The night after Bash At The Beach where Hogan, Hall & Nash formed the NWO we hear from Hogan as he talks about how they will take over and destroy WCW.. . -7/29/96, Backstage Chaos: Jimmy Hart runs to ringside and gets Sting, Savage and Luger to come to the back. We see Hall & Nash beating up wrestlers in the back including Rey Mysterio being thrown head first into a trailer. This actually felt pretty real even for a wrestling show.. . -8/12/96, Scott Hall & Kevin Nash vs. Sting & Lex Luger: Starts off with Luger taking on both men, then Sting blind sides Nash & Hall and we have more of a brawl than anything else. 6/10. What this is remembered for is the beginning of referee Nick Patrick joining the NWO. The horsemen run down and run the Outsiders off.. . -8/26/96, Taking Over: We see the final couple of minutes of Sting/Luger vs. McMichael/Benoit, (yes I said Benoit), the NWO comes down and Hogan brands McMichael, Sting and Benoit. The Horsemen come down but they get taken out. Good segment where the fans throw more stuff into the ring and at the NWO.. . -9/9/96, The Turncoat Sting?: Luger gets called to the back by referee Nick Patrick and we hear from a limo Sting telling Ted DiBiase he needs to take Luger out. Sting appears out of the limo and he and the NWO beat up Luger in the rain.. . -9/16/96, Vindication: The real Sting appears one night after the War Games match the night before where he was thought to have joined the NWO. He proved he was not a traitor that night and here in the ring he says those who doubted him can stick it. Great segment.. . -11/18/96, Easy E's Reign Begins: Piper comes out, the crowd goes nuts and he confronts Bischoff. We get the usual ramblings from Roddy and this leads to the NWO coming down and it being revealed that Bischoff is part of the group. Very well done segment.. . -12/30/96, Rey Mysterio vs. Dean Malenko: A very good rivalry in '96 that continues on the final Nitro of the year. Its short but very good moves by both men. We do seem some actual mat wrestling from Mysterio along with his high flying moves. Dean uses some wear down offense including working on Rey's knee. There was a 10 minute time limit that expired so that match is declared a draw. 7/10.. . Extras. . -8/29/96, Rey Mysterio vs. Mr. JL: Good match here, JL is Jerry Lynn (pre-ECW), its quite good given the short time its given. Rey ends up taking this one with a springboard hurricarana. 8/10. A good NWO moment where Hogan, Hall and Nash spray paint the production truck is also shown during the match.. . -Diamond Dallas Page Monday Nitro Highlights: A montage of his best moments on Nitro, good extra here.. . -6/9/97, Afraid of Heights: DDP is interviewed where he talks about how Sting saved him and took him up into the rafters. Pretty cool extra here.. . Disc 2: The Peak and Plateau. . -1/13/97, DDP vs. Mark Starr: This is a fairly quick squash that sees DDP hit the Diamond Cutter and cover Starr for the win. The aftermath is much better than the match as Hall and Nash come down to recruit DDP to the NWO, but while Nash's back is turned DDP hits Hall with the Diamond Cutter much to the crowds delight. He then ducks and Nash goes out of the ring almost sending a table into the crowd, DDP then celebrates going through the fans as they cheer.. . -3/3/97, Suspended: Eric Bischoff comes out and cuts a promo talking about how the NWO is the reason they are all here in this arena. Harvey Schiller the president of Turner Sports comes out and after a couple of minutes he suspends Bischoff, which as the crowd going nuts.. . -3/17/97, From The Rafters: As the Steiners and Harlem Heat are having a match, the entire NWO comes down and destroys all four men. Luger and The Giant come down and clear the ring. Some pyro goes off in the rafters then Sting decends from the ceiling and the crowd goes nuts and I mean nuts. He gets up on the second rope and points his bat at Hogan who looks absolutely terrified.. . -4/21/97, WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match, Rey Mysterio vs. Syxx: Not a bad one here, Syxx had Nash at ringside and Rey seemed a little more agressive than usual. Rey almost has the title won, when Nash interferes and Jacknifes Rey, Syxx locks on the crossface chicken wing and the ref calls for the bell. 6/10. Post match sees a fan run into the ring and get kicked by Syxx and Rey is carted to the back and put in an ambulance.. . -8/4/97, WCW Championship Match: Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Lex Luger: Its Hogan vs. the man the NWA and WCW believed could be the next Hogan, Lex Luger. Power for power here, Hogan wears down Luger in the early going with kicks, fists and clotheslines, in fact besides a small flurry by Luger, Hogan dominates the first part of this match, having him pinned down but not out a few times. Luger does kick out of the Hogan leg drop, then makes his comeback, taking out the interfering members of the NWO. He slaps on the Torture Rack and Hogan gives up. Winner and new WCW Champion, Lex Luger. 6/10. The crowd went absolutely nuts for the finish and various WCW stars come out to celebrate with Luger.. . -9/1/97, The NWO Parody: This was the infamous mockery of Arn Anderson's retirement speech, where the NWO well mainly Nash, Konnan, Syxx and Buff Bagwell mock the Four Horsemen. Its stupid in parts but I found parts of it funny. Being a fan of the Horsemen like I was it was a little much to watch the whole thing.. . -9/29/97, Buff Bagwell vs. DDP: Pretty decent one here as Bagwell's ego come back to bite him as DDP makes his comeback, Vincent interferes and gets the Diamond Cutter and then one for Bagwell right after, DDP makes the cover and wins. 6/10.. . -10/27/97, Hulk Hogan vs. DDP: Here we see the final few minutes with Hogan beating up on DDP, but no matter how hard he tries DDP just won't stay down. The NWO runs down and beats up on DDP, Sting makes his way through the crowd and beats up the NWO.. . -2/2/98, Sting vs. Randy Savage: Pretty good but short match here, with two of the all time greats. Sting takes it to Savage early on before Randy turns it around beating on the Stinger. When Savage actually had Sting down after the elbow drop, Hogan stops the pinfall causing a DQ. 7/10. Luger comes down and runs off Savage, the NWO gets run off and Hogan follows to avoid facing Sting.. . -3/30/98, 1,004 Holds: Chris Jericho cuts a promo where he talks about how he knows more moves than Dean Malenko. Its an entertaining segment with Chris in his heel stage. Funny stuff.. . -7/6/98: WCW Championship Match, Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Goldberg: With 43,000 plus in the Georgia Dome on hand, this match saw the mega launch of Goldberg as he beat Hogan for the WCW World Title with the spear and jackhammer. Major, major league pop for the finish, though the re-dubbing of the music with Goldberg's WWE music was pretty annoying. 8/10.. . -7/20/98, WCW Tag Team Championship Match, Kevin Nash & Sting (Champions) vs. Scott Hall & The Giant: Its not a bad tag team match, but this was more about Nash wanting to get his hands on his former best friend Hall. There's a good face/off between Nash and Giant. While Sting has Hall down, Bret Hart interferes, Hall hits the Outsider Edge on Sting from the top rope and he covers Sting to win the tag team titles. 7/10.. . -8/3/98, Chris Jericho vs. Rey Mysterio: Jericho was the Cruiserweight champion but this was a non-title match, but also a very good one too as these two have rarely had an off match. Rey was in revenge mode as Jericho had injured him several months back and just recently cost him a title shot at Hog Wild. With the referee down and Rey having Jericho pinned, Dean Malenko came down and counted Chris out, so Rey wins. 8/10.. . -9/14/98, WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match, Juventud Guerrera (Champion) vs. Billy Kidman: This was right after Kidman and everyone else had walked away from Raven, thus disbanding The Flock. Its actually a very good match and shows why fans loved the cruiserweight wrestlers as both men just go all out. Kidman hits the Shooting Star Press to win the title, great match. 9/10.. . -9/14/98, Ric Flair Returns to WCW: Great emotional segment that saw the return of Ric Flair. Nice promo by Arn Anderson and great promo by Flair. The tension between Flair and Bischoff felt so real mainly cause almost all of it was. There was a major, major, major pop for Flair when he came out to the ring. Best segment on the DVD in my opinion.. . -10/26/98, United States Championship Match, Bret Hart (Champion) vs. DDP: The night after DDP almost won the world title from Goldberg, he has the chance to beat Hart for the U.S. title. Bret was a lot dirtier in his tactics as he uses the ropes during some submission holds and cheats to gain the advantage. DDP does make a comeback and when Bret misses with a loaded punch, he gets the Diamond Cutter and DDP covers to win the U.S. title. 8/10. Afterwards Bret uses a chair to destroy DDP's leg and he locks on the sharpshooter, Goldberg runs down and Bret leaves.. . -12/28/98, Ric Flair vs. Eric Bischoff: For the control of WCW, we have a segment/match, Bischoff tries to leave but the Horsemen (Benoit again included) carry him to the ring and Flair beats up on Eric. The NWO and the Horsemen brawl around the ring, The Giant comes down and goes to chokeslam Flair, but Savage comes to the ring, hits a lowblow on Giant and leaves the ring. Ric slaps on the figure four and Bischoff gives up. 7/10.. . Disc 3: The Fall and the End. . -1/4/99, WCW Championship Match, Kevin Nash (Champion) vs. Hulk Hogan: Boy did WCW build this up during the show and during the entrances, it had such a big main event feel. Unfortunately this featured the finger poke of doom, where Hogan barely touched Nash who fell down and Hogan covered him to win the title. Such a waste, but honestly kind of a fun segment, so 7/10 as a segment. Goldberg runs into the arena to get revenge but he gets beaten down and thus began the downfall of WCW. It did get a great reaction from the crowd though.. . -3/29/99, How To Stop The Spear: In Toronto, Canada, Bret Hart cuts a promo in the ring that has the crowd hanging on his every word. Its a very good, real emotional speech by the Hitman. Goldberg comes down and spears Hart, but he's knocked out, Bret stands up and takes off his jersey to reveal a metal plate. He then tells Bischoff he quits. What a great segment.. . -4/26/99, WCW Championship Match, DDP (Champion) vs. Sting: This is the definition of a great title match, both guys really bring their A-games and there are plenty of close calls. Sting blocks a Diamond Cutter and hits the Scorpion Death Drop to win the title. 9/10.. . -6/21/99, Eddie Guerrero vs. Juventud Guerrera: It was Eddie's first match on Nitro since his car accident months back and while not great it was quite good as Eddie was more agressive than normal while he showed very little ring rust and Juvi did get some high spots in as well. Its always great to see Eddie in the ring as his WCW stuff was very underrated by the company. Eddie wins after hitting the frog splash in a good comeback match. 8/10.. . -8/9/99, Sting, Goldberg & Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash, Sid Vicious & Rick Steiner: For the first time in over 3 years Hogan returned to the traditional colors of red and yellow, which had the crowd going nuts and thats what this match is most remembered for. Its not a bad six-man tag match, though I don't understand what Rick Steiner is doing with all these main eventers, nothing against him but he doesn't seem to belong here. Hogan, Goldberg and Sting hit their usual moves, Hogan hits Sid and Nash with a chair, Sting locks on the Scorpion Death Lock on Nash and the referee calls for the bell. 7/10.. . --8/16/99, Billy Kidman vs. DDP: It starts as an interview where at one point Kidman mentions DDP's wife, which brings DDP down to the ring and he starts to beat on Kidman. This turns into a pretty good match as Kidman takes a beating but just won't quit. DDP even had Kidman down but pulls him up before the 3 count a couple of times. DDP goes for the Diamond Cutter but gets rolled up by Kidman for 3 in a bit of a shocking upset. 7/10. Great aftermath where DDP hits the Diamond Cutter on the referee and then on Kidman.. . -12/20/99, Match For The Vacated WCW Championship, Bill Goldberg vs. Bret Hart: The previous night at Starrcade Bret had suffered a concussion that would lead to the end of his in ring career and while he did well that it was quite obvious that he was a bit off. Good match though that sees Hall and Nash come down and beat Goldberg with baseball bats, soon Bret joins in the beating, Piper comes down to protect Goldberg. Bret covers Goldberg to win the title. 7/10. Jeff Jarrett comes down and hits Piper with the guitar and we see the rebirth of the NWO.. . -1/24/00, Match For The Vacated WCW Championship, Sid Vicious vs. \"Commisioner\" Kevin Nash: Power for power here and both men try and the crowd cheers for Sid but its not really that good of a match. Each guy does hit some impressive moves, though Nash wearing Sid down with a sleeper is a bit of a downer in the pacing of the match. Jeff Jarrett interferes but gets knocked out, Sid hits Nash with the guitar and pins him to win the world title. 5/10.. . -4/10/00, The Bischoff & Russo Era Begins: Everyone on the roster was around the ring, Russo talked about change, Bischoff comes down and does excellent mic work especially when he rips Sting, Luger and Sid. Russo and Bischoff say they're rebooting the company, thus everyone is stripped of their titles. This started the New Blood/Veterans angle that ran for a while. Its a pretty good piece in the history of WCW, though it is quite a long segment.. . -4/24/00, Steel Cage Match For The WCW Championship, Jeff Jarrett (Champion) vs. DDP: Not a great cage match honestly but not horrible, though there is some nice brawling on the outside before both men enter the cage. There's some good action and some interference by Mike Awesome but Kaynon stops him and DDP covers Jarrett for the win to become a 3-time champion. 6/10.. . -7/18/00, Six Man Tag Team Ladder Match, 3 Count vs. The Jung Dragons: We open with former MMA fighter Tank Abbott introducing 3 Count who bring a ladder to the ring. Basically the idea is to climb the ladder and get 3 Count's gold record. Its not very long though there are a couple of brutal falls from the ladder, including Shannon Moore getting a huge suplex from Jamie Noble. Evan climbs the ladder gets launched out of the ring, and looks like he wrenches his ankle badly. Jamie climbs the ladder and grabs the gold record to win. 6/10, cause it was so short.. . -8/7/00, WCW Championship Match, Booker T (Champion) vs. Lance Storm: Horrible commentary by Mike Awesome who had one of the worst gimmicks ever in wrestling history and that covers a lot of ground. This was during Lance's best run in WCW as he had three titles and was going for the big one, but standing in his way was Booker T. Its not a bad match at least Booker and Storm try hard. But its fairly basic as Booker fights out of the Canadian Maple Leaf and hits the Book End to make the cover and retain his title. 6/10.. . -9/4/00, Triple Cage War Games Match for the WCW Championship, Sting vs. Scott Steiner vs. Kevin Nash vs. Jeff Jarrett vs. Booker T vs. Kronik vs. Goldberg vs. Vince Russo: Every 2 minutes a man comes into the match and honestly I don't know how to call this match. The idea is you have to climb up to the second cage, then the third one, grab the title belt then make it back into the first cage and out the door with the title in hand. Confusing? Somewhat, Sloppy? Yes, Badly booked? Absolutely. It is a tad fun for being a confusing mess, there's some good weapons used, the Harris Brothers also make an appearance on behalf of Vince Russo. Near the end, Goldberg is about to walk out with the title when Bret Hart comes through the crowd and kicks the door in Goldbergs face. Nash walks out with the title in hand along with his buddies, Jarrett, Steiner and Russo. 5/10.. . -3/26/01, Vince Buys WCW: We get the promo from Vince McMahon on Raw where he announces he has bought WCW, which didn't need to be on here as we already know that he won the war.. . -3/26/01, Sting vs. Ric Flair: Not their best encounter but it certainly was emotional given that this was the final Nitro ever. They did have some good back and forth action, though Flair was very blown up as he hadn't wrestled in months and he was wrestling with a shirt on which he never did. Sting nails a superplex and locks on the Scorpion Death Lock and Flair gives up. 6/10. When these two hugged and shook hands afterwards it was a very emotional moment.. . Its certainly some of the best and some of the worst moments and matches from Monday Nitro's history and it was certainly a great time capsule. DDP was also a very refreshing host on this DVD. I think I can safely say this is a worthy purchase for anyone's wrestling library, I know I'm happy I bought it.", "timestamp": 1313971200, "rating": 5.0, "sentiment": 0.1752504796198824, "overall": 7.938126199049706, "wordCount": 1008, "customer": {"customerId": "A3N0LBOUQAD1BG", "name": "Jonnathan Ritland", "cluster": 1}, "product": {"asin": "B00FWVXRNE", "title": "The Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro with John Cena Rumbler", "brand": "Hulk Hogan", "imageUrl": null, "price": -1.0, "categories": ["Genre for Featured Categories", "Sports"], "avgRating": 4.215909090909091, "avgSentiment": 0.3344350332222884, "avgOverall": 7.551996673964812, "reviewCount": 88}}, {"summary": "A mandatory Ring for all Wagnerians", "review": "Patrice Chreaus legendary 1976 centenary production of Wagners mammoth tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen was one of the theatrical events of the 20th century and this DVD set (recorded in 1980) is a mandatory purchase for all Wagnerians. For once Deutsche Grammophons sales spiel does not lie. Just like Stravinskys Rite of Spring decades earlier, this staging caused a riot when it was first seen, the Bayreuth audience split right down the middle in their hatred/love of what Chreau had done to their beloved Ring. Though there had been important precursors (Joachim Herzs 1973 Leipzig production for one), Chreau confidently jumped off in a fresh direction directing the cycle in a way that had never been seen before at Bayreuth. The fact that he did so in such an accomplished way (if it was technically shoddy it would have been easier to dismiss) at the very shrine of Planet Wagner sent shock waves across the world and changed Wagner production (and arguably opera production in toto) forever.. . It was Chreau who more than any other introduced into the modern conscience (his ideas actually go back through Giorgio Strehler to Walter Felsenstein in the 1930s-40s and then to Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig at the turn of the century) the idea of regietheater (directors theater) to an art-form which had hitherto been the domain of traditional naturalistic/realistic obeisance to composers stage directions. On seeing Chreaus desecration traditionalists clamored to have their naturalistic Ring returned to them and Bayreuth duly obliged in 1983 with Peter Halls faithful, but ill-fated rendering. Then there was the New York Wagner style inaugurated by Otto Schenk, his 1989 Ring held up as a model production by some, but decried as a sterile museum piece with absolutely nothing to say by others. Regietheater (or produceritis as detractors call it) on the other hand has continued unabated with sometimes outstanding, but often ridiculous results, especially at Bayreuth. The last three shock at all costs Ring productions have barely turned a head, the fact that you could still buy tickets for this years cycle on the net even after the festival had started telling its own story as director-centered ego-trips continue to drive audiences away. In truth Chreau has a lot to answer for, but from where I sit there is obviously good traditional Ring production (Nikolaus Lehnhoff, San Francisco 1990) and bad (Schenk), just as there is good regietheater Ring production (Kupfer, Bayreuth 1988) and bad (La Fura dels Baus, Barcelona, 2007). An open mind is what is required. For me the Chreau is an example of top quality regietheater which works almost perfectly. It should be noted that at Bayreuth the volatility of its hostile reception was matched by the warmth of the 90-minute standing ovation it received at the end of its final performance in 1980.. . Its perhaps hard for audiences now to understand the furor surrounding Chreaus production. There have been so many weird and wonderful stagings of the Ring since that the Chreau now looks decidedly old-fashioned and is probably the regietheater production that traditionalists will like the most. In the tradition of Felsenstein Chreau pays attention throughout to the text as sung, and also respects Wagners stage directions a lot more than is given credit for. We are given the Rhine, proper giants, Alberich turning into a proper wurm and then frog, a neo-classical Valhalla, a factory floor Nibelheim, real forest settings, a romantic mountain top quasi-Greek temple Valkyrie rock, a huge dragon wheeled around on stage and a neo-classical Gibichung hall set on the shore of the Rhine. Magic fire traditionally envelops the Valkyrie rock and the tetralogy closes with an immolation of real flames with Valhalla clearly burning in the background. Wagner would have recognized this Ring and outwardly there would appear to be not a lot to complain about.. . However, place Chreaus production in the context of every Bayreuth Ring production that had preceded it and the grounds for complaint become obvious. Since the re-opening of the festival in 1951 there had been four different productions, two each by Wagners grandsons  Wieland (1951 and 1965) and Wolfgang (1960 and 1970). All four had emphasized the mythic timelessness of the piece with an abstraction that had contrasted markedly with the naturalism of the three pre-war productions that had also been directed by members of the Wagner family (Wagner himself, his widow Cosima and their son Siegfried) and the 1933-42 Heinz Tietjen cycle. The post-war New Bayreuth Entrmpelung (clearing out the attic) style served the double purpose of de-politicizing Wagner (ie; stripping it of those naughty Nazi trappings) as well as returning to the ideas of Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig wherein the stage is stripped of inessentials and the central dramatic idea is honed in on and emphasized along with character psychology. For Wieland in particular it was important to return Wagner to his roots and his origins in ancient Greek tragedy. In his productions characters were turned into virtual Greek statues which combined with the spare treatment of the mise-en-scne to make for music drama which moved the audience primarily through a combination of the music and the ambiguity of time and space. Detractors accused Wieland of turning his grandfathers music dramas into oratorios, but it is now accepted that the Entrmpelung style was one ideal way of producing Wagner. Many people in that first night audience for Chreaus Ring remembered Wieland and Wolfgangs productions fondly and what they now saw amounted to downright provocation.. . For Chreau social context was everything and he flouted all convention by setting the Ring squarely in the modern age of an industrializing European society. Das Rheingold is set in the late 18th century pre-industrial world, Die Walkre in the stage of early capitalism with Hunding the first entrepreneur/factory owner, Siegfried in the age of 19th century industrialism, and Gtterdmmerung in the interwar period of fascist capitalism. The pin-pointing of time and place tells us that Chreau is trying to reflect the very world that Wagner himself lived in, and also that far from characters being gods, giants and dwarfs, actually they all represent different aspects of the human species. In this respect Chreaus basic concept (though he denied ever having one as such) is undoubtedly Shavian. George Bernard Shaw argued in The Perfect Wagnerite that the Ring is centrally an allegory on the collapse of capitalism from its internal contradictions with the world of Man waiting for a hero to cleanse away the lame and cramped government of the godsReally, of course, the dwarfs, giants and gods are dramatizations of the three main orders of men: to wit, the instinctive, predatory, lustful, greedy people; the patient, toiling, stupid, respectful, money-worshipping people; and the intellectual, moral, talented people who devise and administer States and Churches. History shows us only one order higher than the highest of these: namely, the order of Heroes. Chreau with his set designer Richard Peduzzi and costume designer Jacques Schmidt set about stripping the gods of their nobility and making all the characters as close to man (to the very people sitting in the audience) as possible with a clear emphasis on the old story of capitalism encapsulated in the pursuit of power wherein the key characters destroy everything including themselves to get what they want. This left wing socialist message was of course outrageous to the right wing Bayreuth audience who (with more than a little justification!) saw the production as an attack on themselves, a point driven home most of all in Gtterdmmerung act 2 when Siegfried wears black tie, ostensibly to resemble Gunther the weak industrialist who is used by the arch-fascist Hagen, but also of course to resemble the gentlemen of the audience also in black tie and also cogs in (what socialists see as) a fascist machine.. . The pursuit of power through capitalism is emphasized throughout the production with the presence of giant factory wheels half-exposed on the stage side. The opening of Das Rheingold is the very image of man abusing nature to generate power in the hydro-electric dam run by the gold lying beneath it. Theres no depiction of ideally clean nature here, the idea of the Rhinemaidens innocent virginity going for nothing. Chreau turns them into Toulouse-Lautrec whores with Alberichs head up one of their skirts presenting sex as both erotic and sordid  an alternative power source to gold. Alberich stealing the gold is very much second best to the power of sexual love which he has to foreswear as part of the deal. This scene was hugely provocative to an audience used to seeing nature pure and unsullied before the arrival of Alberich, though it is in the text (if not the stage directions!) that nature has been violated before the Ring starts with Wotan tearing down a branch from the world ash tree and going on to fashion a spear with the rules by which he seeks to rule the world. These rules have made nature subservient to man (perfectly visualized by the dam and the prostitute Rhinemaidens), and especially subservient to the talented people who devise and administer States and Churches who we meet in the very next scene  Wotan and his fellow gods. Dressed in late 18th century finery and performing on a metal factory-like stage floor with those huge wheels to the side and the finished neo-classical Valhalla (based on Haus Wahnfried, Wagners Bayreuth home) in the background, the gods deal with the giants in the manner of a modern day business transaction. The descent to Nibelheim is a descent to the proletarian factory floor, the split class setting reminiscent of Fritz Langs Metropolis.. . Deeply shocking was the violence of the raw physicality on display  Wotan hacking the ring off Alberichs finger with blood visible, Fafner bashing his brother to death with his bare hands, and so the provocation goes throughout Chreaus production. In Die Walkre Hundings hut is a fancy bourgeois establishment adjacent to a factory with the owner an entrepreneur surrounded by henchmen who later corner Siegmund for him to spear nastily through the testicles (the place which had violated his wife Sieglinde) with not one, but several malevolent stabs. Siegfried act 1 is centered round a factory forge with a mechanical contraption moving of its own accord as the sword is made a-new. Wotan would appear to be behind this as he is behind the caged wood-bird planted deliberately to guide Siegfried in act 2. This violates Wagners idea of Siegfried being a free hero, but it does accentuate the idea of the Wlsung race personifying Wotans will. By the time it came to Gtterdmmerung many in the first night audience had had enough. Siegfrieds seizing of the ring from Brnnhilde is viciously presented almost like a rape. The depiction of the Gibichungs uncomfortably close to themselves was the ultimate insult to the audience and when the arch fascist Hagen rammed his spear into Siegfrieds back repeatedly with sadistic relish many members of the audience yelled out, Genug! [Enough!] Many later productions have been even more violent and transgressive to the point that audiences these days watch expecting it. But in 1976 this was all new and incendiary for conservative audiences used to watching a different world disconnected from the twisted everyday realities we are all familiar with. Throughout Chreau denies us the Greek statuary of Wieland Wagner as well as the fairy tale winged helmets, robes and tunics of Norse mythology, forcing us instead to rub our noses in Our own dirty little corner. (Tom Sutcliffe).. . Alongside the provocation though Chreau gives us a series of quite wonderfully-lit sets which provide for any number of arresting and deeply memorable stage pictures. The use of spotlights is particularly inspired, especially the strong beam drilling into Alberich and the stage beneath his feet as he curses the ring. The Todesverkndigung forest setting in Die Walkre act 2 is wonderfully atmospheric with soft light contrasting with the otherworldly haloes surrounding Siegmund and Brnnhilde which plays with a huge white sheet draped over the doomed hero in a moment of genius. The preceding Wotan/Brnnhilde encounter is also deeply impressive set in a Valhalla drawing room (not Wagners mountain top!) dominated by a huge Foucaults pendulum which Wotan stops on Das Ende!! at the end of his monolog delivered to his reflection in a giant full-length mirror which he covers with his coat because he can no longer bare the sight of himself. Best of all is the Valkyrie rock modeled after Arnold Bcklins The Isle of the Dead which for once suggests the right kind of ambiguity of both time and place. Like many of the scenes, Wotans act 3 farewell is intensely romantic as is the astonishing last scene of Gtterdmmerung with one of the most convincingly satisfying immolations in my experience, Valhalla burning movingly in the background.. . Im not entirely convinced that a worthy Ring can strip away the timeless mythology and still work and I would agree with detractors in saying Chreau narrows the meaning of the tetralogy down too much. The Ring may be an anti-capitalist rant, but it is obviously about much more than that. By seizing on one textual reading Chreau loses sight of all the others. And yet, the romantic stage pictures he provides combine superbly with an astonishingly high degree of quality acting to completely carry us away and convince us that this is a truly great Ring. Chreau (now sadly no longer with us) was a true man of the theater who believed in long periods of intensive rehearsal between actors leading to the finished result which is both psychologically convincing and completely real. He reduces all the characters of the Ring to mortals, but he makes them feel for and against each other in a way that in 1976 was extremely rare in the opera house. That was the most important ingredient of Chreaus revolutionary take on Wagner, namely the introduction of serious theater into opera production which had hitherto been a matter of outdated static convention. All the central relationships (Wotan/Fricka, Alberich/Mime, Siegmund/Sieglinde, Wotan/Brnnhilde, Siegfried/Mime, Siegfried/Brnnhilde) are superbly drawn with singers basically becoming their characters for the time they are before us. The erotic abandon between the Wlsungs in Die Walkre is extraordinarily intense and giddily romantic, while Wotans farewell to Brnnhilde is a matter of great tenderness and held-in passion. Siegfried/Mime make an inspired double comic act in Siegfried act 1 and those intricate little encounters in act 2 are done with obvious relish by all. The awakening of Brnnhilde and the opulence of the closing duet is outstandingly rendered in that fabulous set as is the Gtterdmmerung prologue love music farewell. Possibly the greatest single span of music in the Ring is Gtterdmmerung act 2 and Chreau makes it superbly gripping, the setting combining with the way the singers react around each other to pitch-perfect electrifying effect. On a personally romantic level this Ring leaves almost all other productions for dead. The only other production on DVD that betters it for me is the Kupfer/Barenboim 1991/92 Bayreuth version which takes off from Chreau in the fabulous movement of the singers and their acting, but in a setting (the famous worlds highway) which effectively returns the Ring to timeless mythology where it rightfully belongs. One thing Chreau does do better though is the final immolation scene which is overwhelming in its effect. Kupfers ending is a disappointing whimper beside it, but on virtually all other points, he scores over Chreau. Especially Kupfer/Barenboim were blessed with extraordinary singing.. . Musically alas, the Chreau Ring is flawed, but it is better I would say than any Ring coming after it except for the Barenboim/Kupfer production. Pierre Boulez was Wieland Wagners surprise choice to conduct Parsifal in 1966 and it was he who recommended Chreau for the centenary Ring a decade later. As with Parsifal (one of the fastest readings ever in the Festspielhaus) Boulez zips through the Ring very quickly blowing away the cobwebs with an extraordinary passion which belies his cold analytic reputation. The orchestra rebelled against him in 1976, but by 1980 they had been won over and on these DVDs we hear a wonderful blend which is much closer to Karl Bhm (1966) than it is to Barenboim (1992). The problems come with the singing which is uneven. There are no problems with the Nibelungs and the giants, all four voices commanding the sound picture as they should. Hermann Becht is an outstanding if not obviously evil Alberich, Heinz Zednik excels as his slippery brother Mime and steals the show completely in Das Rheingold as Loge. Hes the link between Gerhard Stolze and Graham Clark as great Bayreuth Loge/Mimes. Matti Salminen and Fritz Hbner make perfect baleful black as black giants. Salminen is my favorite Hunding on record while Hbner dominates the stage as Hagen with superb malevolence. The Wlsungs make a very good looking pair, Peter Hoffman singing with heroic ardor and making those cries of Wlse! long and spine-tingling. Jeannine Altmeyer is a slightly unsteady Sieglinde (not ideally pure of tone) and makes for a wobbly Gutrune. Hanna Schwarz makes a biting Fricka firm of tone and decisive (her appearance in Walkre act 2 is a highlight). The biggest problems come with the biggest roles and as they are on the stage the longest, this is a serious flaw. I have to say that I cant be completely objective about this recording. This was my first Ring recording, the one I listened to on LP endlessly as a teenager pouring over the libretti with an enthusiasm I can barely muster now. Inside me Donald McIntyre, Manfred Jung and Gwyneth Jones have always been Wotan, Siegfried and Brnnhilde, and I love their performances deeply, but when I later discovered the best Ring recordings of the 50s and 60s (Bhm, Krau, Knappertsbusch especially) I realized the shortcomings of what I had been used to. McIntyres Wotan is of the noble type, ideal for Das Rheingold, but ill-equipped to reveal the complexities we see in Die Walkre let alone the world weary bitterness of the Wanderer in Siegfried. His voice is soft, sometimes underpowered and never less than dignified, but he doesnt capture Wotan in his fullness (on record for me only Hermann Uhde, Hans Hotter and later John Tomlinson do that). Manfred Jung would be welcomed today as a savior among heldentenoren, but sadly the microphones reveal his less than heroic tone which must qualify a gallant effort. He gives much pleasure, but cannot get to the places Siegfried Jerusalem let alone Wolfgang Windgassen could. Jerusalem by the way gives a cameo here as Froh which is very effective. Dame Gwyneth alas is the biggest problem for me, a wildly unpredictable voice spreading at the top and wobbling at the bottom. As a teenager I was astonished by her thinking that her singing of the love duets and then the immolation was extraordinary, but when I heard Birgit Nilsson, Astrid Varnay and Martha Mdl do it I realized what I had been missing. One thing does remain with me about Dame Gwyneth and that is the way she sings Ruhe, ruhe, der got [Rest now o god] early in her immolation scene. That send shivers up my spine in a way that no other singer even has or probably ever will!. . A mandatory Ring for all Wagnerians then, its a legendary production well worth paying close attention. Chreaus directing is outstanding in every way. Musically its not as great, but then I don't think its as bad as some have said, and certainly on DVD only the Kupfer/Barenboim Bayreuth Ring betters it. Finally I should mention that the aspect ratio is 4:3 as this comes from the days before wide screen. The images have been cleared up by remastering but ghosting is still inevitable in scenes where light and dark are contrasted in extremes. There are no problems with the sound which is full, bright and relays that amazing Bayreuth glow.. . Cast details:. . DAS RHEINGOLD.

The drive-in experience was classic. \"Jersey Boys\" is anything but.. . The continuity department overseeing the film must have been on strike or asleep on the job. Dramatic license is one thing, but \"Jersey Boys\" screws up the timelines of the Four Seasons' story so badly that, by the time the film finishes with their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1990, you feel sorry even for guitarist/singer Tommy DeVito, who founded and damn near destroyed the group in the same lifetime.. . It only begins with someone who knows even the rudiments of the band's history knowing damn well that Frankie Valli couldn't possibly have been singing \"My Eyes Adores You\" as a lullaby to his little daughter in the mid-1960s . . . because the song wouldn't even be written until 1974, and Valli wasn't usually the one who provided the germs for their songs, anyway. He began making solo records on the side in 1965 and hit solo paydirt in 1967 with \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You.\" Shame Clint Eastwood and his crew didn't remember---he depicts the song as Valli's great comeback record in the 1970s---even as the Four Seasons were still together as a hitmaking proposition and charting in 1967 and 1968, even if Joe Long replaced original bassist/bass voice Nick Massi in 1966.. . The film says \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" was co-composer Bob Gaudio's bid to shake Valli out of his depression following the death of daughter Francine. Good call, guys: Francine was killed in 1980, six months after stepdaughter Celia was killed in an automobile accident, by which time Valli's second run as a hitmaker (beginning with the aforesaid \"My Eyes Adored You\" in 1974) was just about finished.. . And it was \"My Eyes Adored You,\" not \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" as the film depicts, over which Valli and Gaudio (keyboards/vocals/chief co-songwriter) had to fence to get it released at all. The third-generation Four Seasons (Gaudio had retired from touring and begun concentrating strictly on writing and producing---as he still does; Massi's replacement Long had left the group; and, DeVito was long enough gone, too, about which more anon) recorded it while they were under contract to the Motown subsidiary MoWest, but MoWest refused to release it. Valli and Gaudio finally convinced Private Stock Records to take a chance on the song, and it went to number one, launching a terrific comeback for Valli.. . What the film got right: Tommy DeVito was the Season most likely to become a made wiseguy if music hadn't come into his life. And he was squeezed out of the Four Seasons over his financial irresponsibility---he was supposed to be handling the band's finances, but he ran up such a deep bill with loan sharks and the IRS over his gambling habit that the group forced a showdown ending with Valli and Gaudio agreeing to pay off the debt in return for DeVito leaving the group and surrendering his share in their formal business partnership.. . The problem was that that showdown happened in 1971---not in 1966. The film portrays the showdown concurrently as being the final straw that pushed Massi out of the group. Massi and DeVito did have personality conflicts on the road, but Massi had also tired of touring and wanted just to go home. (The film depicts Massi as having been a Season-to-be from pretty much the early 1950s outset, but he didn't actually join the group until 1961, the year before they started racking up the hits. He left the road but he continued working as the Four Seasons' vocal arranger until the band's contract with Philips Records expired.) Massi also surrendered his partnership in the Four Seasons' song publishing, prompting a name change of their publishing company from Gavadima to Seasons Four; he may also have been put off by a deal between Valli and Gaudio: planning to push Valli as a parallel solo performer by 1965, possibly as a hedge against the Seasons' infighting destroying any career momentum, Gaudio and Valli made a handshake agreement to split the proceeds from that plan 50/50---an agreement to which the two men have lived up to this day, strictly on a handshake.. . The Seasons were due to undertake a British tour in 1971; when DeVito was forced out of the group, they put it out that he'd left because of hearing problems. The Seasons weren't inclined to wash their dirty laundry in public; their story may have been as tortuous as the Beach Boys' story, but the Seasons themselves preferred to keep their problems out of the public eye.. . The film gives almost little sense of where the Seasons came from in actuality. DeVito and Valli did come up on the rougher Jersey streets, but except for a couple of scenes depicting Valli at home with his parents you get no sense of their backgrounds. Valli seems to have had a somewhat normal childhood, albeit one of some struggle (his father designed displays for Lionel Trains; his mother worked for a beer brewer). DeVito grew up with an abusive father, which surely pushed him to the street life and the petty crime in which he indulged pretty much until the Seasons' career (initially as the Four Lovers) began showing signs of paying off, but it isn't even hinted, never mind mentioned in the film.. . Massi is shown as almost a woodenhead; he, too, is given no background shrift. Gaudio---the Season who wasn't Jersey born or (mostly) bred (he was a Bronx boy)---was probably the only member of the group who didn't grow up with any kind of family turmoil, much the way George Harrison was the only Beatle who grew up without family trouble, but the film offers nothing of that background. (The comparison is apt in more than one way: like Harrison in the Beatles, Gaudio was the youngest Season; he was barely out of his teens when he uncorked \"Sherry\" in 1962, after producer Bob Crewe suggested he write a song playing to Valli's vocal strength, especially his shattering falsetto.). . Generally, Gaudio is portrayed as a musical genius who could barely see what else was in front of him until he found out the hard way, which wasn't necessarily true. No mention is made of his actually having been a child prodigy whose parents encouraged his musical passions and who gave a Carnegie Hall piano recital at age seven, before his parents moved the family out of the Bronx into Jersey. The fact that Gaudio was a teenage hitmaker (he co-wrote \"Short Shorts,\" a big 1958 hit for the Royal Teens of whom he was a member at fifteen) before being brought into what became the Four Seasons (by way of an acquaintance with future actor Joe Pesci, a lifelong friend of DeVito's, who pumped Gaudio to the group as a songwriting whip) is mentioned barely in passing.. . His finest hour of instant inspiration doesn't even rate that much mention. You can't make any production about the Four Seasons without \"Rag Doll,\" of course, but the song's sweet backstory doesn't even rate a passing hint. In early 1964, Gaudio was stopped at a Manhattan traffic light after leaving a recording session. One of the New York squeegee kids came over and cleaned his windshield for him. He fumbled in his pocket for something to give her but had nothing smaller than a five dollar bill. He gave the girl the bill, anyway. As he began to pull away to turn toward the Lincoln Tunnel back to New Jersey, Gaudio saw her in his rear view mirror---standing in the middle of the street, holding the bill in her hand, gaping at him. And he noticed how she looked in her soiled dress and gaping face: \"She looked,\" he thought to himself, \"like a rag doll.\". . When he got home, he wrote a song about her, standing the Seasons' previous hit \"Dawn (Go Away)\" on its head and forging a story about a well-off guy's parents pressuring him to dump the girl from the wrong side of town. With an arrangement that stood Phil Spector's Wall of Sound squarely on its head---Gaudio and Crewe achieved a wall of sound with nothing but Gaudio's keyboard, DeVito's guitar, Massi's bass, Buddy Saltzman's thundercrack drumming (as session drummers not affiliated with the Funk Brothers went, Saltzman was easily Hal Blaine's equal and probably could have held his own in bands like the Rascals or Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels), and an unknown studio musician playing a glockenspiel, behind the Seasons' well-honed voices---\"Rag Doll\" was a smash. And the last Four Seasons record by the original quartet to hit number one.. . The backstory would have made a remarkable segment in the film. If only Eastwood and company had either known it or bothered to see it for what it was.. . The musical performances in the film should outrage anyone who was a serious fan of the Four Seasons in their hitmaking heyday. The Seasons' 1960s records featured the punchy soul-style drumming of Saltzman, but the way the music is played in the film it would put to sleep the grannies in Branson Missouri. The music played in the film (all four actors playing the original Seasons could sing---they'd been in various stage productions of Jersey Boys---and the actors playing Gaudio, DeVito, and Massi could play their instruments) is lifeless, limpen, and punchless, nowhere near the uptown R&B that underwrote the Seasons' original style. John Lloyd Young, who played Frankie Valli on Broadway and won a Tony Award for his effort, cuts the teeth out of Valli's normal tenor and building-shattering falsetto here, and there are moments where he can barely hit the notes. The chunky guitar and earthy bass of DeVito and Massi are flatted into ghastly stiffness by their screen counterparts. The stand-ins for Saltzman (there are several shown in assorted recording studio scenes) look as though the very idea of hitting the drums at all scares them to death.. . If Eastwood was that tentative and that uninformed about the Seasons' music, why didn't he just dub the Season's original recordings into those scenes? Some of the group's biggest hits don't even show up except in out-of-time, out-of-continuity snippets if at all. Don't expect to hear anything like \"Save It For Me,\" \"Big Man in Town,\" \"Let's Hang On,\" or \"Beggin',\" among others. And while we're on that subject, don't even think about expecting to see anything involving the Four Seasons' most ambitious project of all, the criminally underrated 1969 concept album \"The Genuine Imitation Life Gazette,\" the group's bid to shed their hip-to-be-square image, Gaudio teaming with folk songwriter Jake Holmes to deliver the material. The album became an anomaly in the group's catalog--\"Idaho\" is just about the only song with anything like the classic Four Seasons sound---but critics slowly and surely came to love and appreciate it. (It also featured the first album cover based on a front-page-newspaper design, four years before Jethro Tull got the same idea for \"Thick as a Brick.\"). . That album might have escaped the band's fan base but it had one fan of note---Frank Sinatra. Ol' Blue Eyes was so impressed with the ambitious work from his fellow Jersey boys that he hired Gaudio and Holmes to write him a concept album, the likewise criminally underappreciated \"Watertown.\" (About a man's life following the crackup of his marriage---a subject with which Gaudio was acquainted initimately enough considering the turmoil involving the Seasons' marriages.). . Eastwood couldn't even get one small but critical detail about the group right: They were never billed as Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons prior to 1969, when the billing first appeared on their single \"Patch of Blue.\" The standard billing for the group on their records, first at Vee-Jay and later at Philips, was \"The 4 Seasons Featuring the 'sound' of Frankie Valli.\". . History has its claims, dramatic license be damned, and you grant it wasn't simple to mulct the Four Seasons' story for even the original stage hit. (The surviving original Seasons cooperated with both; Nick Massi died in 2000.) It probably wouldn't have raised any objections (other than perhaps Valli being discomfited over any depiction that two of his children got dead in 1980, when showing just the one was painful enough for him) to have told things the way they really were, and in the real order in which they happened.. . Eastwood and the writers are so inept at understanding real nuances in musical figures that they never once address a critical facet to the Four Seasons' approach: They were somewhat older, with a different kind of working class sensibility, than the rock and roll generation into which they flew forth, and they weren't exactly rebels with or without a cause if you didn't count the street and Mob surroundings in which three of them grew up. \"The Genuine Imitation Life Gazette\" might have satirised American life and culture but it did so from the point of view of thirtysomething men (one of whom, DeVito, was only two years from fortysomethinghood) who'd kicked themselves the hard way into the upper class, not from that of dreamy hippies, college students (none of the original Seasons got much past high school, assuming they went even that far; even Gaudio, the straightest member of the group, quit high school when the Royal Teens were compelled to tour on \"Short Shorts\"), or bohemians. It should have been a natural for Eastwood considering his sensibilities outside film, but he doesn't even seem to have been aware that the album existed, considering he's barely aware that the Seasons had more hits than \"Sherry,\" \"Big Girls Don't Cry,\" \"Walk Like a Man,\" or \"Dawn (Go Away).\". . The likely (if inadvertent) seed might have been a \"Working My Way Back to You\" track, \"Beggar's Parade,\" in which Gaudio and Crewe questioned the sincerity and credibility of the street protesters beginning to make a larger presence in 1966. (This was the last album on which Nick Massi was a full-time participant.) A beautiful song otherwise, \"Beggar's Parade\" might well have had a legitimate argument, but in 1966 it only reinforced the Four Seasons' image as singles-oriented squares. Eastwood's supposed to be this oddly insightful director who's supposed to have had something to say in his equally shortfallen biopic of jazz legend Charlie Parker (\"Bird\"), but failing to hone in on the sensibilities behind the Seasons' music---even (especially?) through such a jarring album cut as \"Beggar's Parade\"---exposes him as a musical halfwit.. . Frankie Valli continues performing and recording to this day. (He made a pleasant but overlooked album of 1960s covers---covers of songs he'd never recorded before in his life---a few years ago.) Bob Gaudio has long since relocated to Nashville and has continued a respected career as a writer and producer since backing away little by little from the Four Seasons in the late 1970s. (Among his projects: Neil Diamond's album hit I'm Glad You're With Me Tonight, the blockbuster Diamond/Barbra Streisand duet \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers,\" and Eric Carmen's first---and best---solo album, including the two hit singles it yielded, \"All By Myself\" and \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again,\" plus future work by Roberta Flack and Peabo Bryson.). . Tommy DeVito relocated to Las Vegas (some of his siblings already lived there) after his forceout from the Four Seasons with $100,000 in the bank. He ran through it in a year, then took up housecleaning as a profession, marrying a Vegas showgirl who'd quit when her show went topless. He got back onto his feet slowly, raising a family and eventually becoming a recording studio operator and producer, not to mention getting some low-keyed film work thanks to his old friend Joe Pesci. He swears to this day he left the Four Seasons of his own volition, tired of touring, and insists Nick Massi left the group because he wanted to be more of a frontman, though neither is borne out by the actual facts. As for Massi, when his work as the Seasons' vocal arranger ended, he lingered in the music business awhile but ended up fighting a battle with the bottle for years while sometimes painting portraits of peoples' pets for a living.. . You'll have to surf the Internet to learn those things, because you won't learn them---as, alas, many other things---from \"Jersey Boys.\" The Four Seasons made some of the 1960s' most memorable music, even if it's been short shrifted a) by critics who dismiss them as just a doo-wop group who got lucky with a bunch of hit singles; and, b) by the Seasons themselves, accidentally. (They took control of all their masters each time a label deal ended, leaving the labels with nothing to keep in print, meaning no Four Seasons album---granted most of their '60s albums involved hit singles and filler for the most part, other than the brilliant \"Rag Doll,\" \"Working My Way Back to You,\" and \"The Genuine Imitation Life Gazette\"---remained in print very long, leaving their music relegated to assorted anthologies for years.). . It's a shame that both the music and the story behind it got so badly bowdlerised by a filmmaker with so little feel for the music and less for telling the story right, warts and all. Since Frankie Valli and Bob Gaudio served as executive producers for both the stage hit and the film, you can't help wondering at which point they threw up their hands and said, more or less, \"OK, we can live with this, long as we get paid . . . \". . One thing the film does allow a hint about turns out to have been true, by the way: the Four Seasons' 1970s hit \"December 1963 (Oh, What a Night),\" in which they tried revolving lead vocals for the first time on a Four Seasons single, really did reference the night Bob Gaudio lost his virginity---at 21, and with a little help from his friends. Except that the film won't let you hear Valli straining to contain a smirking giggle while singing his parts, since he was the only Season left while making that record to know its backstory.", "timestamp": 1497484800, "rating": 1.0, "sentiment": 0.0701168999612578, "overall": 3.6752922499031446, "wordCount": 1063, "customer": {"customerId": "A1LKBVKBHII5T5", "name": "BluesDuke", "cluster": 0}, "product": {"asin": "B00J9BZOXY", "title": "Jersey Boys 2014", "brand": null, "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JkrtGkG-L.jpg", "price": 16.71, "categories": ["Studio Specials", "Warner Home Video", "All Titles"], "avgRating": 4.339746056175452, "avgSentiment": 0.4635357746334643, "avgOverall": 7.998585492759113, "reviewCount": 2599}}, {"summary": "A lifetime's exploration", "review": "NOTE: This is a review of the four Tales of the Four Seasons, currently available in Amazon.co.uk's catalog though Amazon.com doesn't appear to be aware of it. It also includes an overview of Rohmer's non series films. It is for real fans of Eric Rohmer's movies, who will want to disagree with me.. . WHEN ERIC ROHMER died earlier this year there was a host of tributes, much talk of his 'talky' films and remarks about watching paint dry. My tribute was to watch his films again, including the ones I had not seen, and review them. I have a very strong attachment for some of his films, and have had one for 20 years. Before discussing his films however I should add a bit of context.. . Rohmer was a writer first of all, a novelist, then a film theorist. He learnt his craft in television as a maker of documentaries. Many of his film scripts would work as plays, and I don't know why no-one has staged My Night at Maud's. Rohmer was a literary man, and some of his films are based on the work of other writers, such as Kleist and Chrtien de Troyes. He helped form a group that added enormous energy to French cinema, la nouvelle vague, but paradoxically he had a great admiration for some of the directors that movement swept arrogantly aside, such as Marcel Carn. In his astonishingly vivid creation of landscape and context for his films' characters, Rohmer has always reminded me of Georges Simenon, one of the greatest 20th century French writers and a major influence on French cinema. And one of the precursors of la nouvelle vague was Jean Eustache, creator of La maman et la putain, a four hour film of conversations between Jean-Pierre Leaud and Bernadette Lafont and Franoise Lebrun which I think one of the greatest French films ever made. Rohmer was of course a good businessman, able to produce small budget/films-on-a-shoestring that made tenable his career, as did many of la nouvelle vague directors, and Ingmar Bergman and Satyajit Ray as well. Most of all he was a moralist, someone who felt strongly that to live well one has to have values that are worthwhile, and his films are designed to make us think of those values, though presented in an unobtrusive and utterly charming way.. . Great French film directors? In my view they include Marcel Carn, Coline Serreau, Jean Eustache, Alain Resnais, Rene Clement, Louis Malle, Jean Renoir, Jacques Audiard, Claude Sautet ' and Eric Rohmer.. . Finally, talk of literary influences and film movements should not obscure the fact that Rohmer had a command over many of the traditional elements of film making. Much has been said of his evocation of landscape, and of figures within that landscape. He is known for his mastery of set design and colour, and rarely needed an art director. He worked hard with his framing and cutting to create a natural effect, a kind of candid camera effect, that took hours and sometimes years of planning. And he was probably one of the best directors of actors ever, getting marvellous performances from inexperienced actors again and again. Because he wasn't flamboyant or technically intrusive, as Godard was for instance, there are some who don't notice this competence (hence the 'nothing happens, people just sit around and talk' kind of comment). In fact Rohmer was technically innovative right through his career, more so than any other French director. And the this-is-not-a-film ambiance he created is just as deconstructive as Godard's this-is-a-film approach.. . So on to the films of Eric Rohmer, who asks you, not 'what if an evil force was trying to control the universe and only one man could save humanity from a fate worse than death', but 'what if a group of people were able to express their thoughts and feelings, in an elegant and subtle language, how accurate would they be in describing their real situation, and what would we learn about human nature by listening to this?'. . The Four Seasons. Rohmer liked to film in series, and his last one was Tales of the Four Seasons. Although filmed when Rohmer was in his 70s, these films show no falling off, and in fact include one of his best films, still using the diary cue cards that make you think it's a home movie, and still eliciting great performances from unknown actors.. . A TALE OF SPRINGTIME (Conte de printemps) 1990. A Tale of Springtime is a slice of life about two couples in unsatisfactory relationships, and the daughter of one of them who ineptly tries to improve the situation through a bit of matchmaking. It's extremely naturalistic, and the story has no real beginning, no resolution to the events portrayed, and no real ending. It's just like my life in this respect, in fact, and perhaps like yours.. . Many of Rohmer's film making characteristics are here: the unobtrusive camera work, the subtle and assured use of colour, the script which deftly reveals personality traits in small actions and everyday phrases. The central character is a musician as well as a matchmaker, and music plays a part in the story, and is also played on the soundtrack, which is rare to hear in a film by Rohmer.. . Where the film falls down in my opinion is with the actors. Though the script is good (but not great), and the actors present it well, none of them are Rohmer actors, which means they are not natural and at ease. I was never in doubt throughout the film I was watching a performance. While it didn't stop me enjoying the film, I never found it involving.. . A WINTER'S TALE (Conte d'hiver) 1992. A Winter's Tale is a moving account of how a young woman comes to live the story of the Shakespeare play, with a little encouragement from Pascal. These aren't musty cultural figures from the past for Rohmer but relevant commentators on everyday living. A cautionary tale that teaches that if you want to receive a blessing you must first be in a state of grace.. . The film is built around the character of Flicie, played by Charlotte Vry. If you can fall for her, the film is absorbing: I thought her portrayal brilliant, one of the best acting jobs in any Rohmer film (if you haven't seen a film by Rohmer, that means it's world class). Flicie has a holiday romance that's with the love of her life, loses touch with the man, has a daughter, and lives in Paris in an uneasy relationship with two men. She loves both men, but there's love, and there's love. Flicie comes to see, through chance encounters and conversations with friends, that if you want something to happen you have to believe it will. In a conclusion that cynics will deplore, she finds that miracles happen, but only to people who believe they exist.. . Another atypical Rohmer film with a musical score. And, as usual, superb realisations of place, streets, apartments and shops of Nevers, Paris, with characters seemingly always on the move in trains and buses. It has part of a good performance in French of The Winter's Tale by Shakespeare as well. Flicie is inarticulate, unsure what she wants, irritating in her indecision, she makes mistakes, acts stupidly and hurts the ones who love her, but she's a lover who keeps that love alight in her heart, and anyone who's ever loved will surely understand what she's going through before her epiphany.. . Rohmer, now aged over 70, has produced yet another example of the Rohmer paradox: a literate, well balanced construction with characteristics of a stage play, played in superb naturalistic style by gifted actors, and filmed and edited using effectively and with great skill all the resources of cinema. For some reason his films seem difficult for viewers who accept unhesitatingly that a man can blow up a building with a hand gun, and prompt critics to apologise for pointing out his merits as a director. I think he'll be disparaged, after the obituaries settle, but will come back as one of the masters of cinema, when his colleagues of the New Wave have all been forgotten. And because he examines you and me he'll always be uncomfortable for viewers who want to live forever in never-never land. So be it.. . A TALE OF SUMMER (Conte d't) 1996. A Tale of Summer looks at the other side of summer romance to the lyrical beauty that glows from the beginning of Rohmer's previous seasonal tale, Conte d'hiver. Here a young man, on holiday in Brittany, has not one but three romances, and finds it necessary to put his song writing career first, for which his feelings for the three girls provide inspiration, because they all present him with problems he can't solve.. . Now in most films there's a plot, and the plot is always about possession, of land, of money, of a woman. Because the story is melodramatic, it is always unrealistic. Rohmer attempts something much more ambitious in his films, to portray real feelings in real people, in all their ambiguity and state of flux.. . In A Tale of Summer it's probably this emotional current running through the gestures and actions of all the characters that is the real subject of the film, and it is shown in its ambiguity and state of constant change. It's something we're not comfortable with, preferring to give labels such as 'love', 'friendship' and so on to what is after all the motor that drives us through life, and is frequently unknowable and disquieting.. . Gaspard, played convincingly by Melvil Poupaud as a gangling, introverted and sensitive misfit who pours his emotion into his songwriting, mets Margot, who's an ethnologist and part time waitress. Margot is played by the wonderful Amanda Langlet from Pauline at the Beach, an actress seemingly born to act in Rohmer films but who was only in three. These two develop a friendship, which is 'more important than love', and we see it mutate slowly into love, with attendant jealousy, until it is restrained on one side by duty and on the other by diffidence. With superb irony, we see the couple don't realise it is love until after they part at the end of the film. Instead, Gaspard is obsessed by a girl he thinks he loves but who clearly doesn't love him, and then by another he lusts for but who demands a level of commitment he can't rise to.. . Such a neatly constructed story could be trite, and would be trite in other hands. But Rohmer as usual creates three dimensional characters, who exist in a fully realised landscape and express themselves through natural dialogue which is only a little bit more clever than you or I would use. And the dialogue is so well written, and the acting so perfect, we can see deep into the emotional wellspring of each person, deeper in fact than they can see themselves or others. I see the film as a revisit to one of Rohmer's earliest and greatest films, My Night at Maud's, where an unobservant man meets the love of his life and doesn't know it. Here, such is Rohmer's artistry, the same psychic pattern is repeated, and seems totally original.. . As seems his intention for the Seasons series, Rohmer links the scenes through music, and here it is songs about seafaring, about travelling vast distances and missing those left behind. I wonder if Rohmer had in mind that one day Gaspard might sit down and make a film about Margot?. . AN AUTUMN TALE (Conte d'automne) 1998. Like a Tale of Springtime, this is another matchmaking story in which Isabelle (Marie Rivire) and Rosine (Alexia Portal) try to find a partner for Magali (Batrice Romand). If this seems a slim story to occupy 112 minutes of screen time, it is. Matters are drawn out by a series of contrivances that never delve too deeply into the participants' feelings. In short, a relatively superficial story from Rohmer.. . It is also a story of friendship between Isabelle and Magali, and two of Rohmer's favourite actresses bring a warm tone to the ups and downs of their relationship as it is affected by the plot to find a partner for Magali. There's always fine acting from Rivire and Romand, and Romand especially shows herself still to be one of the world's best actresses, a magnetic presence in every scene she's in. A well constructed if slightly too symetrical script from Rohmer, a fine picture of the French countryside, well acted by all the lead actors, yet, atypically for Rohmer, somewhat shallow, at least in comparison to his best work.. . But still a comfort to watch, a film about normal people in plausible situations, a refuge from the torrent of films out of America about serial killers, vampires, superheroes, vendettas, revenge murders, corrupt cops, urban violence, psychotics, and the cult of violence that has taken over American cinema, and American society, over the last 30 years.. . Experimental films. Rohmer is known for his naturalistic tales of relationships, but a third of his film output is of a completely different nature. Many of these show Rohmer pushing the conventions of cinema to their limits, and he is in this respect the most experimental of directors. Most of these non series films have not been commercially successful, but obviously were important to Rohmer in some other way.. . There are the literary adaptations. Kleist's La Marquese d'O (1976), characterised by natural lighting, the most beautiful set designs in the world, and scenes that are reminiscent of paintings by David or Ingres come to life. Rohmer, with a plot that demands ignorance of the female reproductive system, highlights the period of the story by using period acting conventions. L'Anglaise et le duc (2001) is an adaptation of Grace Elliott's memoir about the French Revolution. For some reason Rohmer's depiction of the terrorism practised at that time has got him labelled as 'conservative': he is in fact showing his usual maturity of judgment. This time the sets are even more beautiful than La Marquese d'O's, hand painted, and I think very great works of art in their own right. Unfortunately the natural lighting does not work, as most scenes are indoors or at night, making the 'action' somewhat obscure. Rohmer's 'Last Supper'. These two films are cinematic painting rather than conventional film dramas. Catherine de Heilbronn (1980) is from a Kleist play, and is similar in spirit to La Marquise d'O, though set in the middle ages. It was premiered on French television. I have not seen it.. . Perceval le gallois (1978) is a faithful adaptation of a 12th century poem by Chrtien de Troyes. Spoken and sung in verse, in the incomplete form of the original (presumed left unfinished at Chrtien's death) and accompanied by music of the period played on authentic instruments, it is presented in a style more familiar from opera than cinema. Non naturalistic sets, colours reminiscent of medieval painting and with a similar lack of perspective, it will be unsettling to the Rambo crowd, but riveting for anyone interested in the myth of Arthur, the Grail legend, and medieval music and poetry. Les amours d'Astre et de Cladon (2007), Rohmer's last film, made when he was 86, is an adaptation of a novel by Honor d'Urf: both are an exposition of a now unfashionable genre, pastoral, a highly stylised and artificial treatment of romantic love featuring nymphs and shepherds in a she-loves-me, she-spurns-me, we-are-reconciled cycle that now looks idiotic. It does give Rohmer a chance to celebrate the undefiled countryside, one of his great loves. I have not seen it.. . Rohmer revisits recent French history in Triple Agent (2004), about White and Red Russian agents in Paris during the German occupation. Scrupulously accurate, though with some details added for Rohmer's own purpose, and given a documentary feel by the inclusion of newsreel footage, it is a film about the erosion of trust, the impossibility but necessity of political choice, and the degree to which we control those choices or not, seen through an examination of the effects of political involvement on a marriage. L'arbre, le maire et la mdiathque (1993) is a comedy about local politics which treats of matters not that different to those that agitate my local council and cause a storm of controversy, revealing that everyone has an opinion but nobody knows what to do. An expression of Rohmer's concern for conservation. Interesting to see Rohmer examining politics with the same penetration he brings to bear on personal politics.. . Closer still to Rohmer's trademark comedy drama is Le signe du lion (1959), his first feature. Here an expatriate American loses a fortune in Paris and survives as a hanger-on in rich society, trying to compose music but not getting very far. The camera follows Jess as he wanders around Paris trying to survive. Very audaciously 'new wave' as it was, your reception of the movie depends on how you like Paris. 4 aventures de Reinette et Mirabelle (1987) is just as the title says. I find it very similar to his Comedies and Proverbs, but far more humorous, with a humor I just can't appreciate. The same goes for Rendez-vous in Paris (1995), which I saw years ago but was not able to re-view for this survey. Three tales of almost love, set in Paris, the star of the film (as in so many Rohmer films).. . '  '  '  '. . In a 50 year period Rohmer produced 24 feature films, and the remarkable thing about his films is how watchable most are. In writing my review I looked at what other people had to say about the films, and found that there were many who went to print to say how they disliked and despised Rohmer's films. Some even said he was incompetent, though this comment wasn't made by a film maker. Some said he just made the same film again and again (but, hey, Porkys 10 is OK, and here comes Freddy for the umpteenth time and that's OK. By the way, have you noticed that everything by Mozart sounds the same? So unoriginal, some composers. Now, Megadeath') Let's say that there is space in film for all tastes, and perhaps Rohmer just surprised some viewers who had limited experience of the variety possible in film making. Among those who liked Rohmer's films I noted there were those who singled out the films I found least interesting as his best, and those who disparaged and disliked the films I thought the best. That's the way it goes.. . Despite what anyone says, I would not like to be without the tragedies of lost opportunities, My Night at Maud's, Love in the Afternoon and A Summer's Tale, nor the tender comedies of foibles such as A Good Marriage and The Aviator's Wife, nor the inspiring comedy of A Winter's Tale, nor the lyrical romanticism of My Girlfriend's Boyfriend or The Green Ray. All these films exhibit insight and compassion, and it would be a pity if the unobtrusiveness of their achievement caused them to be overlooked for films more strident and pyrotechnical.
