While V/H/S had its ups and downs there is no way you could say that it wasn't a formula that worked in this situation, having several noted horror film directors make pieces of a complete story that interconnected. So one would think that their newest release, THE ABCs OF DEATH, would be a good movie too. Unfortunately that's not the case.. . The situation is similar but more overblown. Rather than 4-5 directors this time we have 26 directors, one for each letter of the alphabet, given a letter and told to make a short piece involving death. Some run no more than 2 minutes and some longer, but each one is a miniscule time capsule where they allowed the director complete free reign to do as they felt and make whatever they wanted, no holds barred. That doesn't always turn out to be a good idea as is evidenced here.. . Some of the pieces are actually quite good given the time and budget constraints. Some are mediocre which you might expect. The surprising thing is the number of terrible pieces involved here that seem to outweigh the good ones. Some even go so far as to be as offensive as they possibly can. If you choose to watch keep in mind that the Japanese sense of horror and film is far more outlandish and extreme than anything witnessed in this country. Gore and blood doesn't so much flow in these pieces so much as spew forth in an alarming amount as if blood vessels were connected to garden hoses rather than a single heart pumping the fluid through a body.. . The more I've thought about this the worse the movie has actually gotten. I watched it last night and decided to let that sit a while before writing. Rather than make the film more palatable it's made me dislike it even more. It opens with a gory beginning piece that uses extreme make up effects to good use when the final punch line is delivered but doesn't remain in that format for long. The better of the pieces are found in the beginning of the film and from there it becomes weirder, more unusual, more graphic and more offensive.. . Everything can be found here that would please those who seem to think that the world wants exposure to the worst forms of humanity possible. Freddy and Jason are child's play to the things witnessed here. Just to give you a run down of ideas here are some of the things you will witness in this film: Japanese girls who enjoy breaking wind, a women with a 6' by 1' thick penis that includes a giant switchblade sword, claymation toilet monsters, a contest where contestants masturbate while witnessing sexual scenes that start with a nude woman and end with a child being raped (not seen but inferred, still totally tasteless and excessive) and lastly a miscarriage turned into a joke (not funny for those of us who have lived through such a circumstance). I have no doubt that in criticizing such items I will be labeled a prude and told that I just don't understand art. This is one time when I find that more of a compliment than an insult.. . It's not always a bad thing to have film makers push the boundaries a bit. It sometimes leads to some amazing films. The problem lies when they push the boundaries simply to just push the boundaries, just to shock or simply to just see what they can get away with. That almost always leads to poor film making, poor judgment and just bad movies as is witnessed here.. . Have I seen films where worse happens than in this film? Sure. Find out about NEKROMANTIC of AUGUST UNDERGROUND and you'll discover what I'm talking about. While those to films have a cult/underground following this film is being marketed as a more mainstream film. Somehow I think that the neighborhood where this film is considered fun or entertaining is far past Elm Street, Mockingbird Lane or the neighborhood of the Addams Family. Unless you just have to see it or enjoy crap posing as art, then my recommendation would be to bypass this film as quickly as possible and pray that a sequel is not in the works.", "timestamp": 1369958400, "rating": 1, "sentiment": 0.0668414588057445, "overall": 3.667103647014361, "wordCount": 348, "customer": {"customerId": "A2DAHERP7HYJGO", "name": "Mark Turner", "cluster": 5}, "product": {"asin": "B00B04NJLW", "title": "The ABC's of Death", "brand": "Ingrid Bols Berdal", "imageUrl": null, "price": 8.34, "categories": ["Science Fiction & Fantasy", "Fantasy"], "avgRating": 2.5542168674698797, "avgSentiment": 0.0335839095122054, "avgOverall": 5.138176641250394, "reviewCount": 249}}, {"summary": "Five Stars", "review": "Because Deadpool.", "timestamp": 1470441600, "rating": 5, "sentiment": 0.0, "overall": 7.5, "wordCount": 2, "customer": {"customerId": "ASKF8U0LYI0HW", "name": "Amazon Customer", "cluster": 1}, "product": {"asin": "B01BDUS0NY", "title": "Deadpool 2016", "brand": null, "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61bSCosTgUL.jpg", "price": 13.45, "categories": ["Studio Specials", "20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "All Fox Titles"], "avgRating": 4.4611680646163405, "avgSentiment": 0.3657840722968696, "avgOverall": 7.875628245358515, "reviewCount": 6438}}, {"summary": "Three Stars", "review": "I like Martial Arts movies,this one i will 3 star.", "timestamp": 1440633600, "rating": 3, "sentiment": 0.0, "overall": 5.5, "wordCount": 10, "customer": {"customerId": "A2AX6D2PCA1FW2", "name": "milton Hall", "cluster": 0}, "product": {"asin": "B000OYNUKO", "title": "Hung Hei-Koon: Shaolin's Five Founders", "brand": null, "imageUrl": null, "price": 15.99, "categories": ["MOD CreateSpace Video"], "avgRating": 3.950617283950617, "avgSentiment": 0.3590785870222598, "avgOverall": 7.348313751506267, "reviewCount": 81}}, {"summary": "Good dvd to keep the kidos entertained", "review": "Got this for my 1 year old son..he loves chica and we are currently watchin it now..fast shipping", "timestamp": 1415836800, "rating": 5, "sentiment": 0.05, "overall": 7.625, "wordCount": 21, "customer": {"customerId": "A2ST4DDKEFYP66", "name": "Aj", "cluster": 3}, "product": {"asin": "B00FBRCY06", "title": "The Chica Show: Meet Chica!", "brand": "Christopher Brasfield", "imageUrl": null, "price": 12.99, "categories": ["Genre for Featured Categories", "Kids & Family"], "avgRating": 4.871428571428571, "avgSentiment": 0.3467938537157287, "avgOverall": 8.238413205717894, "reviewCount": 70}}, {"summary": "A look at Brazilian Crime from a Brazilian perspective", "review": "As an American the only real look into the crime in Brazil I have was the movie City of God.
