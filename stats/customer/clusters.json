I know a lot of people were disappointed that there wasn't enough action or it didn't have much of an ending, but the thing people have to realise is that it's based off a book that was not intended to be a trilogy.  They also have to realise that it's the first movie in the series, and so of course there's going to be a lot of introduction as to who's who and what's going on.  People also have to realise that there's a lot of different story lines in the books, and you couldn't put all those different plots into a movie.  There's a lot of ways you could translate the books, and the movie is just one of those translations.  Jackson decided to go with the main plot, which was destroying the One Ring.  So there's things he cut out that don't pertain to that concept.. I think this movie has to be one of the greatest movies ever.  Steve Jackson is a great director.  He did a very good job of taking the books and bringing them to life on the silver screen. I know another complaint people had was how much that wasn't in the movie.  There were a lot of complaints about, say, Tom Bombadil not being in the movie.  Tom Bombadil was a great character in the book, but obviously if Jackson had put everything in the movie that was in the book, instead of watching a 3-hr. movie (4 if it's the extended version), you'd be watching at least a 6 or 7 hour movie (and that's just Fellowship!).. There's also some awesome acting in the movie.  I'm not one to go to a movie just because of the actors, but some of these actors I've seen in other movies, like Elijah Wood and Orlando Bloom, and I have to admit that every movie I've seen them in, they've always done a great job.  There's also a couple actors that I haven't heard of before, but they also did a really good job of bringing the characters to life.. I definately recommend the extended version of Fellowship of the Ring to anyone that likes any kind of fantasy.

This is something you will never forget, the tale of a hotel manager that helped to save 1,000 refugees.  The tutsies and the hutus were 2 rival races of the same people in Rwanda during 1994.  The hutus attempted to take over the country of Rwanda while the tutsies couldn't stop them.  The UN couldn't help, european and western nations couldn't help, in fact they all left.  The refugees were left to fend for themselves.  The main character, Paul, is played Don Cheadle and no one could have done a better job.  This compelling tale of a Hutu that saved hundreds of people, both hutu and tutsie, by risking his life is not only moving but action packed to the very end.

I have bellydanced quite a wee while now, too many years to add up! And I have also purchased too many Bellydance and exercise DVDs to add up.  Recently I had abdominal surgery and was trying to get back to my normal (rather hectic) routine of bellydance, pottery, horse riding and exercise.  I found myself losing my balance, getting distracted, oddly weepy, tired and generally not feeling my normal self.  Well this DVD addressed many issues that I had been ignoring.  The exercises on this DVD encouraged me to center myself, calm down and re-connect with earth.  I now really rely on this video, it is a dance workout which addresses more then warm strong muscles and a raised heart beat.  The Chakra Dance Flow allowed me to stop running madly and instead to stand strong, with acceptance.  I practice the longer dance flow at least twice a week and its positive effects for me are huge.
