I finally found a movie that was worse than the remake of Dirty Dancing! Oh yeah it is way worse. It is so bad that I wanted to poke out both of my eyes just with the hideous music and the never ending opening credits, yet I soldiered on to the actual movie. Much to my surprise, it was actually worse than the opening credits! I lambasted the remake of Dirty Dancing...She's FAT. She can't dance. She has NO charisma and who the hell is that guy who also can't dance and has no charisma....but this movie makes Dirty Dancing look worthy of viewing, which it  most definitely is not. This movie is so bad that I am starting to question my Prime membership that would allow this movie to be part of the membership benefits. Amazon, what the hell were you thinking? This movie is not worthy of being in the never watched section of block buster. Yes, it is really that bad. It is so bad that I am going to petition Amazon to start allowing fractional stars.

Supposedly based on a real life crime, this is the story of a couple that meets on the internet and fall in love.  In order to achieve true together-ness, the boyfriend decides that that girlfriend must literally eat his heart.  So, after thinking about, she decides to do just that.  Later, she's arrested and severely beaten by immates who had been paid off by her boyfriend's mother.  Dying in the hospital, she re-tells the who story to a pair of detectives.. . There are so many problems with this movie.  While the premise sounds vaguely interesting, it seems like the writers and directer simply could not flesh it out.  The movie is loaded with the same shots shown two, three, or four times.  Other times, there are extended scenes where the girl, after killing her boyfriend, simply does nothing but walk around or ride around town on a scooter.  Maybe the filmmakers could have used the time develop the backstory and try to figure out A) Why the boyfriend would want to do this, and B) why the girlfriend would agree to it.  At one point, the boyfriend simply throws out the idea of eating his heart, and when his girlfriend recoils, it suddenly dawns on him that his girlfriend must not love him.  What?!?!  Then, deciding that she really does love him, she agrees to the plan.  Again, what?!?!  I mean, I love my wife and child, but being eaten by them does not seem like the best way I can prove my love.  We don't really learn anything about the backstories of these characters except that the girl's father died when she was young and that the guy's mother really loves him.  In fact, we see flashbacks of the mother telling her son this and hear voiceovers from the father to his daughter, from letters he wrote her before his death from some disease.  Neither of these things add anything to the story nor do they explain the motivations of the characters, unless the boyfriend took mom's \"I love you so much I could eat you up\" quote literally.. . Another problem is the direction.  The pacing is awful.  The movie crawls along at a snails pace.  The story is told in non-sequential flashbacks, which isn't really a good way to tell a story.  Every time the audience returns to the hospital room where the girl is telling her story, the scene is shot in a blurry, shakey style which, I suppose, is supposed to mirror the girlfriend's state of mind but it really annoying to the viewer.. . Lead actress Jillian Swanson is so awful it defies explanation.  She shows zero emotion.  She has the same expression throughout the whole movie and seems extremely uncomfortable in front of the camera.  Lead actor Trevor Parsons is slightly better, but he's not good.. .

We never get a clear motive other than the girl's father died when she was 6 and the guy's mother is really mushy and smothering. There didn't seem to be enough there to create two people this disturbed!. . The pace, the dialogue, the acting and the camera work are HORRID! They also keep showing the same scene with the making love, kissing and her tying him up and killing him. They show this OVER AND OVER AND OVER as flashbacks as she is in a hospital bed trying to explain it to detectives. They could have cut these EXTENSIVE and useless scenes down and added some backstory. The music is also the SAME annoying track over and over. The whole movie is ridiculously repetitive! Instead of watching this, why not just play a broken record for 80 minutes? That would probably be more entertaining than this film!. . Every scene is drawn out and longer than it has to be. The movie is all \"filler\" and no meat! There are LONG lingering shots of Los Angeles, about 10 minutes of lambs being slaughtered and cut up and lots of other pointless scenes that do nothing for the story other than make it drag. They could have fit the plot into 10-15 minutes of screen time and they would have been doing us a HUGE favor! This is too terrible of a movie to be funny, it is so bad, it's just BAD! Also, nobody mentioned THE HUGE hole in the plot. She is supposedly in PRISON for murdering the guy and gets beat up by other inmates. So WHY are the detectives questioning her when she is obviously dying and they clearly had enough evidence for her to be in jail to begin with? If they already know she did it why ask her what happened? It doesn't even make sense!. . The only redeeming quality is the actress who plays the main character is very pretty and we see her nude but her acting is AWFUL! True she didn't have much of a script to work with and it didn't look like she had a good director either. I think the actors needed to be pushed harder. They don't even seem like they are trying! Sadly though, I don't think this script could have been saved...that is if they even HAD an actual script!
